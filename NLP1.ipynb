Why should I spend my time listening to you? You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule. What would you have me do with him? A ruler who kills those devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion. Remove Ser Jorah from the city. You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. Let me fight for her. The Iron Bank has called in the crown\\'s debts. We must send an envoy to show these bankers our respect. Ser Meryn will lead your escort. There are only two like it in the world. The one I\\'m wearing, the one I gave to Myrcella. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time. Dorne\\'s too dangerous for you. I\\'ve come to take you home. I love Trystane, I\\'m going to marry him, and we\\'re staying right here. This is about survival. The Night\\'s Watch will let you through the tunnel. If you swear you\\'ll join us when the real war begins. The white walkers don\\'t care. We\\'re all the same to them, meat for their army. But together we can beat them. We still have a hard march to Winterfell and we won\\'t be marching anywhere in this weather. It\\'s better to wait for the right time than risk everything. This is the right time and I will risk everything. Because if I don\\'t, we\\'ve lost. I have shown you the power of king\\'s blood. We don\\'t have Robert\\'s bastard here. We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be. The snow is so deep, we couldn\\'t get an army through to engage them even if we wanted to. I don\\'t need an army. I need 20 good men.    - Look out! - Fire! Fire! A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them. Burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons destroyed. - Dozens of tents were-- - Horses? We\\'re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead. without a single guard sounding the alarm? The northerners know more about their land than we ever will. Put last night\\'s guards in chains. Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them. Your Grace. Unless there\\'s a thaw, we can\\'t press forward to Winterfell and we don\\'t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black. We\\'re not returning to Castle Black. Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters, but if we can\\'t march forward and we won\\'t march back Have the dead horses butchered for meat. Halt!  Halt!  There it is! Open the gates. It was a failure. It wasn\\'t. I went to save them. I failed. You didn\\'t fail him. Or him. Or her. Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else. I don\\'t think that fact\\'s lost on them. You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It\\'ll get us all killed. Out of my way. You sent for me, Your Grace? Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you. I\\'m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander his king commands him to send food, supplies, fresh horses. In return, when I take the throne, I\\'ll make sure the Night\\'s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall if he so wishes. Your Grace, you named me your Hand. Yes. The King\\'s Hand should never abandon the king, especially in time of war. You\\'re not abandoning me. You\\'re obeying a command. A boy with a scroll could deliver this message. And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll, what does the boy say? I didn\\'t name you Hand for your expertise in military matters. Ride for Castle Black. Don\\'t come back empty-handed. Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse and Princess Shireen could accompany me. My family stays with me. At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl. My family stays with me. What\\'s this one now? \"The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling\" by Grand Maester Munkun. Now that sounds like a proper story. Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror. And he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection. But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield. And burnt him to a crisp. Thus ending the dragon-slaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess. Do you like it? He\\'s beautiful. - Thank you. - You\\'re very welcome. Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company? Of course I will. But why am I getting a present? Because you deserve it. My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading. Seemed to me I could make it to the grave. Wish I\\'d listened to him. This is my own poor way of saying thank you. For teaching me to be a grown-up. I\\'ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I want to hear all about \"The Dance of Dragons\" when I\\'m back. You\\'ll read it yourself. Prince Doran. Forgive us. We started without you. Please, sit. Princess Myrcella. Uncle. What a lovely dress. - You don\\'t like it? - You must be cold. Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me. Prince Trystane. How\\'s your jaw? A fleabite. What are you doing in Dorne? Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella. And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly, you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force? We received a threatening message. The princess\\'s necklace in the jaws of a viper. That necklace was stolen from my room. Oh, excellent. A last meal before the beheading? Oh, I can\\'t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I\\'ve seen war. I\\'ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I\\'ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don\\'t want to lead my people into that hell. No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters. And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. King Tommen insists on his sister\\'s return to the capital? I\\'m afraid he does. I cannot disobey my king\\'s command. She will return with you to King\\'s Landing. And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both. If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue, their engagement must stand. I accept. One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the fold. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council. You have my word. The word of a kingslayer. No wonder you can\\'t stand. You have no spine. You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life. Speak to me that way again, and you won\\'t. May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn? Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King\\'s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince? He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished, it\\'s me. Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day. I\\'ll let him decide. I have learned the value of mercy from my father. - I\\'ll set your man free. - You\\'re a good man. On one condition. Why do we play? I\\'m better than you. I\\'ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don\\'t think I have. I can\\'t recall. You must love humiliation. Or pain. Which do you love most, humiliation or pain? That one hurt, didn\\'t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister. - You\\'re going to miss. - Oh, I never miss. You will. You\\'re thinking too much. Now you\\'re nervous. What if she\\'s right? - Luck. - Now it\\'s my turn. You\\'re too slow. You\\'ve always been too slow. Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk? You\\'ll find out very soon. Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I? The most beautiful woman in the world. And that\\'s the truth. - Slut. Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I didn\\'t realize there were knights of the Blackwater. Only the one. I believe you\\'ve already met Prince Trystane. Prince. Sorry about the other day. Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He\\'s agreed to grant you your freedom. I\\'m glad to hear it. Pie looks good. There was one condition. Perhaps some soup instead. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cock-- How much for your little clam? Oysters, clams, and cockles. Oysters, clams, and cockles. Come on. Some oysters, girl! I\\'m talking to you. Is, uh - Girl! -  Tie her up! Are you deaf? Girl! Girl! My lord. My lord. Lord Tyrell. On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the Free City of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble-free. A bit of chop the last few days. Nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor. And how goes the harvest in the Reach? Ah, the vintners say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I\\'ll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor\\'s finest your way. I\\'m afraid I don\\'t partake. Oh. Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course. I\\'m glad we see eye to eye on this matter. Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands. Most unfortunate for the glovers. If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it? Whereas the promise of reward makes a man willing to gamble. We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell. You are the world\\'s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this. We should celebrate. I\\'m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do. Oh, nonsense. Work\\'s over. Do you sing? - I don\\'t have that gift. - Oh, it\\'s not a gift. It\\'s a skill. Anyone can learn it.  So give me a kiss by the Long Canal   And give me two kisses in Salty Town   For we\\'re going to die tomorrow   The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown  Thought that old shit would never stop singing. Wasn\\'t bad, though. The Tyrells can all rot in hell. Treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king. This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos. - You buying? - Oh, I\\'m buying. But I never was good at sharing. Sell your fish somewhere else. Oh, let her in, Brusco. I\\'m hungry. Come here, sweetness. They say oysters get the juices flowing. We\\'ll take half a dozen. Three coppers. Here\\'s a silver because the lady likes you. Too old. Brea. Too old. I have just the one. Anara. Our most expensive girl. But well worth it, I assure you. Too old. Do you have what I want or not? Of course. Of course. These fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry. Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters. - Here. Thank you. - I\\'ll have one. Any vinegar? Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo! Good. I\\'ll tell you when we\\'re done. You\\'ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow? Of course. I\\'ll have you whipped, girl. Go, go on. Out, out, go. Valar morghulis. Valar morghulis. And? The thin man wasn\\'t hungry today. Perhaps that is why a man is thin. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. A girl has work to do. Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die. I believe in second chances. I don\\'t believe in third chances. You write like a seven-year-old. Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me. He didn\\'t try to make you pay? Mm-mmm. Maybe he\\'s changed. The queen will be thrilled to know you\\'re bringing her daughter home. She will. You love her very much, don\\'t you? Of course, she\\'s my niece. I wasn\\'t talking about her. You think I disapprove? Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here no one blinked an eye. no one would have blinked an eye at you if you\\'d been named Targaryen. It\\'s always changing, who we\\'re supposed to love and who we\\'re not. The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want. I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I love. Perhaps even you are innocent of that. Father. Aren\\'t you cold? No. What are you reading? - \"The Dance of Dragons.\" - What\\'s it about? It\\'s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered. \"The Dance of Dragons.\" Why is that a dance? It\\'s just what they call it. Hmm, doesn\\'t make much sense. I think it\\'s poetic. If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have chosen? I wouldn\\'t have chosen either. It\\'s all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible. Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it. It\\'s all right, Father. You don\\'t even know what I\\'m talking about. It doesn\\'t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help? Yes, there is. Good. I want to. I\\'m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And I\\'m your daughter. Forgive me. Where\\'s my father? I want to see my father. It will all be over soon, Princess. No. Where\\'s my father? No, you can\\'t do this. Father, where are you? Please, let me see my father. Father, where are you? Don\\'t let her do this. Please let go! Let me see my father! Where are you? Please! - It\\'s what the Lord wants. - No. - Please! Let go! No! - It\\'s a good thing. - A great thing. -  Stop. Stop! - Please! - Hear us now, my Lord.  You can\\'t do this!  For you, we offer up this girl Please!  that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.  Please! No, please let me see my father. If we don\\'t act, we\\'ll all starve here. -  All of us. But if we make this sacrifice Accept this token of our faith, my Lord, and lead us from the darkness. - Lord of Light, show us the way. - Mother! Mother, please! Mother, please! Mother! - Mother! - We can\\'t. There\\'s no other way. - She has king\\'s blood. -  Please don\\'t do this! Lord of Light, protect us. Please! Father, please! For the night is dark and full of terrors. Father! Father, don\\'t do this! Please! Mother, no! Please! Please, help! Don\\'t do this! Please, Father! Mother, help! No.  No, please! Don\\'t do this! Don\\'t do this, please, Mother! Please, Mother! Mother, help! Mother, help! Help! Please don\\'t do this, Mother! Please! Please, Mother! Please! Please! No! Please! No! No! Where have you been? Just making sure everything is in order. They\\'re waiting for you. Clap your hands. That one, the smaller man. No question, that\\'s where you should put your money. The smaller man it is. I\\'m not putting my money anywhere. Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does. People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake. I\\'ve spent much of my life in this arena. And in my experience, large men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not. Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You yourself? Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you? Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn\\'t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here. And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren\\'t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy. You don\\'t approve? There\\'s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time. Fair enough. Yet it\\'s an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty? It\\'s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor. I\\'m not talking about myself. I\\'m talking about the necessary conditions for greatness. That is greatness? That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt. My father would have liked you. One day your great city will return to the dirt as well. - At your command? - If need be. And how many people will die to make this happen? If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason. Those men think they\\'re dying for a good reason. Someone else\\'s reason. So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They don\\'t know their own minds, but you do? Well said. You\\'re an eloquent man. Doesn\\'t mean you\\'re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles. - Your Grace-- - Shut your mouth. - You can end this. - She cannot. You can. Protect your queen! Go! Your Grace! Your Grace! Come with me. I know a way out. I know a way-- Stay close. This way. The other side. - Follow me. Protect your queen! Drogon! Valahd.\\n']"

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.

These men will not leave our city until our whole family is dead.  This was all my fault. It was me that shot the old man. John\\'s dead because of me.  Within a four-mile radius of the Garrison, every man is a guard and a soldier for us.  We\\'re going back, back to Small Heath. That\\'s how it works.  An eye for an eye. It\\'s called a vendetta.  We are an organization  run different, I imagine.  None of you will survive.  And how is Tommy Shelby OBE going to stop a revolution?  If I get Jessie Eden\\'s trust,  she gives me the names of the instigators, and I give them up to the Crown forces.  I want you to help my son achieve his ambition.  You\\'re a Peaky Blinder now, son.  We control him on the book, control the odds.  We\\'ve got a lot going on though, Tom.  That\\'s why it\\'ll be good to have the kid around.  Mr Shelby will give you a 20% cut  if you put Goliath down in the fourth round.  So you\\'re going to take my boys, and you\\'re going to bring them to the ring as seconds?  Yeah, Tommy Shelby was right about you, wasn\\'t he?  Yeah, you\\'re like me, Tommy.  You can\\'t bear to watch a fight which has got rules.  Tommy, imagine  imagine that you could not see at all,  you was born blind.  Then, one day,  you open up your eyes  and you can see everything in the world  ..when before you could only touch it or smell it.  There it is the revelation, innit?  I\\'ve had one.  Yeah, I saw a beautiful house down in Margate.  A great big white building. Monkey puzzle tree against the sky blue.  Beautiful. A piece of heaven, actually.  You can see the way the Earth curves, and I thought to myself,  Alfie, you know, whatwhat are you doing? What are you doing?  Why don\\'t you just sell every ounce of gold  and sell every barrel of rum you got and just buy yourself some time, mate?  I need to buy myself some time.  You\\'re moving to Margate?  I am, actually, yeah. I need to get myself some rest.  I need some rest.  Plus, the Americans are here now, aren\\'t they?  So, well, that\\'s it, yeah.  It\\'s been that way ever since the war, innit, the Americans?  Big fucks small  ..always, actually.  There is a fight going on out there between big and small.  Big will fuck small.  Right! Margate, then. Blue skies, heaven.  I will see you, Tommy, by the pier.  Stay and watch the fight, Alfie.  No, you\\'re all right. I already know who wins, don\\'t I?  Ta-ra!  Round one.  Fight, you bastard!  Bonnie Bonnie.  Don\\'t you touch it, Charlie.  I know he\\'s a big bastard, but you got to  Where\\'s Solomons? Apparently he doesn\\'t watch.  Look at that corner, look. The men there, they don\\'t know fighters.  I don\\'t like it You feel it though, Tom, don\\'t you?  I feel it. We\\'re all right. We\\'re surrounded by soldiers, Arthur.  Alfie\\'s men were strip-searched, we\\'re all right.  Right, come on, gypsy boy, let\\'s go.  So what did Tommy say when you told him?  He said I\\'ll get a weekly allowance.  Oh, he can be romantic.  Of course, as company treasurer, I shall be questioning that expense.  He said something like, \"We\\'ve had enough death, let\\'s have some life.\"  Pol, this fight is fixed, isn\\'t it?  Well, gypsy boy\\'s getting battered out there.  Right, you said you had some news?  Lizzie has some news.  Polly!  Well, tell her. Now! While the men are screaming for blood.  Have a swig, you\\'re going to need it.  I\\'m up the duff.  And it\\'s Tommy\\'s.  How far gone are you?  If I were going to London I\\'d be in Coventry.  And are you carrying on past Coventry?  All the way to fucking Piccadilly Circus.  Have you found whether she\\'s having a boy or a girl, Pol?  No. Go on, then.  It\\'s a girl.  Call her Ruby. Ruby Shelby.  She\\'ll be a star in a Hollywood movie.  Congratulations.  Hello, Linda. Welcome to extraordinary general meeting  of the Shelby ladies club.  Is there spit on my back?  There are men out there spitting - it\\'s fucking disgusting.  No. There\\'s no spit on your back.  Don\\'t let us stop you doing what you came in to do.  What?  It\\'s helping me get through the fucking nightmare of being  stuck in the city.  Well, since you\\'re here and you\\'re almost family,  Lizzie\\'s got some news.  I\\'m pregnant.  Oh. And who\\'s the father? Have you managed to narrow it down?  Yes. It\\'s Tommy.  Congratulations. You\\'ve won the raffle at last.  Yeah, she\\'s a real Shelby lady now, Linda. Just like you.  Right, ladies, lets rejoin our gentlemen.  And just remember, Linda, if they spit, just spit back.  I\\'ll see you out there.  All right.  Come on, Bonnie!  Right, you Brummie boys!  Forget your loyalty, boys!  You\\'re still in control, Bonnie?  Yes.  Then take him.  It\\'s not too late, boys.  I\\'ll give you 2 to 1 on the big Cockney, Goliath here.  Take it or leave it, boys.  Take it or leave it, boys. 2 to 1.  2 to 1 on the Cockney giant.  Look at them men in his corner, look.  They don\\'t know fighters.  They don\\'t know the fucking ropes.  It\\'s the pills and the booze spooking you, Arthur.  Look at them. They don\\'t stand right, they don\\'t move right.  They don\\'t even care if he fucking wins.  It\\'s the fucking pills, brother, all right?  Whoooo!  What the fuck are they laughing about?  It\\'s that new batchtoo strong.  Come on, Bonnie! Come on, Bonnie!  Arthur, leave it!  Where\\'s he going? Sit down and watch the fight, eh?  Arthur! Come here!  Let me do my fucking job.  Bonnie! Bonnie! Are you OK?  I\\'ll give you two to one now on the Cockney!  Take it while you can.  Right  Come on, Bonnie Boy! Bonnie, come on. Get him!  Where are Tommy and Arthur?  I don\\'t know.  Go on, Bonnie.  Go on, hit him!  Arthur?!  You fucking bastard!  Arthur?!  I declare Bonnie Gold  the new welterweight champion of the Midlands,  the south and the Home Counties.  Yes!  Tommy, what\\'s happened?  Arthur\\'s dead. He\\'s dead.  Tommy, we have the other wop.  The cunt had a wire in his pocket.  Go on, Finn!  Go on, Finn.  Take his eyes, Finn. Do it for Arthur.  Take his fucking eyes!  GROANING  GROANING  Close the doors! No-one fucking leaves!  My brother is dead.  Do you hear me?!  My brother is dead!  Tommy. Tommy.  Fuck off.  Tommy. Tom. Tom. Tommy.  Hello, Michael. There\\'s been a change of plan.  Mr Gold will come and get you.  Arthur\\'s dead.  Tommy, I\\'ve been trying to think of words.  Don\\'t.  Words don\\'t work.  Michael, we\\'re in a grave situation. Tommy has a plan.  Instead of going to Australia, you\\'re going to New York.  Why?  Because the company has business to attend to in America.  Will I be coming back?  Your train leaves in an hour, Michael.  You made a choice.  You knew I was going to be shot and you chose not to tell me.  I chose my mum.  When all this business is over we\\'ll all be free to make our own choices.  So that\\'s it?  You get the train to Liverpool then the SS Monroe.  The boat sails tomorrow.  Now you can go.  I need an overseas connection, please.  USA.  Tommy!  It\\'s all right, let her come!  Pleaseuntil we\\'re finished.  Your note talked about making terms for peace.  But my son says there are no terms.  You took my husband and my son.  We took two of your brothers.  The vendetta is done.  We say the vendetta is won.  We will take everything you have.  All your businesses, signed over to us.  You agree to this or my son will kill you all.  One by one.  The vendetta is won. That\\'s it.  No more killing.  Who did you think you were, Mr Shelby?  Make sure he knows we\\'re here to buy his business!  Mr Solomons!  Mr Changretta is here to see you.  They say he was a captain.  Ah. I think you might want to tell them not to open that fucking door.  It seems Mr Solomons has already left town.  So all this is mine.  You don\\'t knock?  You don\\'t know my new address?  Hello, Lizzie, how are you?  I know your new address, Lizzie,  because it was me who bought you the new fucking house.  Then why don\\'t you visit it?  I\\'ve been busy.  Busy doing what?  Preparing for tomorrow.  Why? What\\'s tomorrow?  Luca Changretta is coming to Birmingham. It\\'s our turn.  He\\'s already taken over Alfie Solomons, Sabini, the Titanics.  All of them.  And now he\\'s coming to take control of Shelby Company Limited.  What are we going to do about that?  We\\'re going to let him have it.  All that\\'s left of the Peaky fucking Blinders.  I\\'ve had my lawyer draw up these papers.  They cover, er, every enterprise in your possession.  Bars, restaurants, warehouses  ..every fucking thing that you\\'ve  taken all these years to gather together.  You will sign them all over to my family.  Or you\\'re going to die, right here.  I would have buried you all.  But my mother, she, er, she knows you.  She said it\\'ll be worse for you  if I let you live  ..and take away everything that you have.  Search \\'em  Especially don\\'t trust this bitch.  So  Sign.  Every fucking one of \\'em.  You can sign them on your knees  on the floor.  Get on your fucking knees and sign!  As a friend of mine once said  ..big fucks small.  So I had to find someone bigger than you.  Now, you may know there are two families in Brooklyn who want  to take over your monopoly on the import of liquor into New York.  But if they moved against you in New York they\\'ll start  a war between the families.  But if you were to die in a vendetta  with some fucking bookmaker in Birmingham,  they could take over your business without a war  We also contacted a businessman in Chicago.  He\\'s also interested in moving into the liquor business in New York.  His name is Alphonse Capone.  You been talking to that fat fuck?  See, all the blood relatives you brought with  you from New York, they\\'re all dead, Mr Changretta.  And these men here, they work for money, for the highest bidder.  They now have new orders.  Is that right?  Is that right?  Daniel?  Matteo?  Hey  Very fucking  Arthur\\'s been injured but he\\'s all right, Pol.  We need to make them believe that he\\'s dead  ..to everyone but you, me and Linda  Arthur Shelby is dead.  I\\'ve got it all worked out.  We can use his death to win this war.  Tell your people in Chicago that Michael Gray will sign  the import licence to New York.  300 barrels of English Dry Gin a month.  Leave! All of you.  Tell your boss what you saw here today.  And tell him  ..you don\\'t fuck with the Peaky Blinders.  Right. Oi! Listen up.  Before we all go and eat, I\\'d like to say a few words.  The last time we were all here, it ended badly.  Yeah.  But now we\\'re in a happier place.  That\\'s it.  I\\'d just like to raise a toast  Hold on.  A few words I\\'d like to say from the heart,  and this time you\\'re going to let me finish, Tommy.  Now as you all know, Arthur Shelby is dead.  Because of that, Tommy\\'s offered me a way out.  A new identity.  Start a whole new life for myself.  And I\\'ve thought about it.  Made a decision.  I ain\\'t fucking going nowhere.  Our enemies are gone. Dead, all of \\'em.  For the first time since me and my two kid brothers  Tommy and John  ..enlisted in the Warwickshire Yeomanry, we have peace.  So, I think I\\'d like to make a proposal.  All of you, the Shelby Company Limited, insist that Tommy  here takes some time off.  It\\'s time you took a holiday, Tom. Put your feet up.  War is over. No-one wants to kill us.  To peace.  To peace.  I do hope you\\'re going to leave the dog out of this?  You were easy to find.  Yeah. There\\'s a good reason for that, Tommy.  I wanted it to be here.  I once told you, Alfie, for business reasons or in bad blood,  I will kill you.  I have no business reasons. It seems you have retired.  So this is all purely for bad blood, is it, Tommy?  Yeah. Right, yeah.  I told you I wanted it to be here.  Are you going to look after this dog?  No. Right, then. Well, his name is Cyril.  He\\'ll be very upset and distressed, so you\\'ll need to find him someone.  You\\'re not armed?  No! Don\\'t be daft.  The only thing I\\'ve got on me  is fucking cancer, mate.  Yeah.  Riddled with it.  Doctor told me  I might have picked it up in France in a gas or something.  He even showed me a photograph of it, before I met you at the fight. Alfie, stop talking.  So I said, Margate, right, and here I am. Come on, Tommy. Alfie, look at me.  There\\'s an honourable reason now to pull that trigger.  Alfie, look at me. So what you waiting for?  Just fucking get on with it, and stop acting like a little girl.  Alfie! Do you want me to do it for you?  Mr Shelby?  Mr Shelby?  Mr Shelby?  Mr Shelby, you are not yourself, I should call a doctor.  It\\'s all right, Frances.  I\\'ll call Mrs Grey.  I know what this is.  It\\'s just myself talking to myself about myself.  Right Thank you.  Charlie  Since I know you won\\'t go yourself,  I\\'ve been to a doctor on your behalf.  No, it\\'s all right. None of the boys know you\\'re sick.  I\\'m not sick, Polly.  It starts when you stop. When you rest.  Could be nerves, the war.  Might be the alcohol.  The blue devils, they call that.  Yeah, well. Yeah. Yeah, it\\'s the fucking booze.  It\\'s the booze, the booze got hold and the booze got in my bones.  Lizzie wants to see you.  No  Tom, she\\'s showing.  I don\\'t want to see Lizzie, Pol.  Shit, maybe it\\'s in us?  It\\'s us Shelbys.  It\\'s in our gypsy blood.  We live somewhere between life and death.  Waiting to move on.  And in the endwe accept it.  We shake hands with the devils and we walk past them.  Mr Shelby, you\\'re meant to be resting.  I have learnt something, Frances.  There is no rest for me in this world.  Perhaps in the next.  Them there you pay out. This one you have to think.  Use your fucking head, man. Right, even money  Whose fucking idea was it that I go on holiday?  Welcome back, Tommy. How was it?  What did you get up to?  Went fishing. Played golf.  Golf\\'s fucking boring.  Yeah, boring and easy.  Yeah, well, what\\'s the plan?  I need you to give this to Jesse Eden, by hand.  Yes, Mr Shelby.  By your hand. This will be the last job you\\'ll do for me.  Go to Glasgow and be with your family. You\\'re free.  You need to sign all of these.  So you shook hands with the devil?  Yeah, and I walked past him.  Pol.  I\\'ve had an idea.  Oh, fuck.  \"Dear Jessie. Now more certainly than ever  \"I believe things must change.  \"Things MUST change.  \"The general strike is holding, we\\'ve not an hour to lose.  \"Meet me.\"  I\\'ve made up my mind, Jessie. About what?  Your cause is now my cause. I want to help.  The strike is holding.  I want to meet the people who can take this further.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I\\'ve done a lot of thinking.  Right. I\\'ll arrange a meeting.  The operator knows my voice. Give me the name and the number.  His name is Casey Douglas.  Sparkhill 453.  Right.  And he\\'s the leader of the cell?  He\\'s in contact with London and Moscow.  Good.  Yeah, Sparkhill 453.  You are quite a creature, Mr Shelby.  When I received your note, I wasn\\'t sure you could deliver.  I have made contact with  the Soviet agent inside the Birmingham Communist Party.  And you have a name?  And an address and a telephone number.  I can be of great use to you.  I can give you the names of any Communist Party member who is  prepared to cross the line into armed revolution.  We are in the fourth day of a general strike which appears  to be holding.  Even if it fails today  tomorrow, they may succeed.  Mm.  And you\\'re offering to help ensure they never succeed.  If my cover is maintained  ..I can begin to shape the movement, organise it myself  And undermine it.  Rise through the ranks of the wider socialist movement.  But, of course, you want something in return. What this time?  A knighthood?  My proposal.  And my conditions.  For the attention of Winston Churchill.  He holds me in very high regard.  Are you serious?  Breaking up a revolutionary cell is one thing.  Given my position of influence in my home city,  I can be of much more use to you than that.  Ronald Carr, Conservative, 3,412  Bernard Hall, Liberal, 4,015.  Michael Ross, Communist, 6,406.  Thomas Shelby, Labour Party, 48,564.

looking\\n\\t\\t\\tlike he witnessed a double homicide\\n\\t\\t\\twere going to talk\\n\\t\\t\\tabout the supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is set to have\\n\\t\\t\\ta monumental year\\n\\t\\t\\tnot only will it take on cases\\n\\t\\t\\tconcerning the availability\\n\\t\\t\\tof mifepristone\\n\\t\\t\\tand whether trumps immune\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom prosecution\\n\\t\\t\\tfor his role in january \\n\\t\\t\\tits also considering one case\\n\\t\\t\\tcentering on something\\n\\t\\t\\tcalled chevron deference\\n\\t\\t\\tit sounds like the title of a spy novel\\n\\t\\t\\tthat youd burn through at an airport\\n\\t\\t\\tbut its a vitally important\\n\\t\\t\\tlegal precedent\\n\\t\\t\\tthat says that when there is ambiguity\\n\\t\\t\\tin the letter of a law\\n\\t\\t\\tcourts should defer\\n\\t\\t\\tto regulatory agencies expertise\\n\\t\\t\\tdo you like it when the epa\\n\\t\\t\\tregulates pollution\\n\\t\\t\\tor the fda regulates drugs\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch of their ability to do that\\n\\t\\t\\tcomes from chevron deference\\n\\t\\t\\tand if the court guts it\\n\\t\\t\\titll be much easier\\n\\t\\t\\tfor private industries\\n\\t\\t\\tto block government regulation\\n\\t\\t\\tso this is gonna be a huge year\\n\\t\\t\\tfor a court that has seldom been\\n\\t\\t\\tmore powerful\\n\\t\\t\\tand yet respect for it\\n\\t\\t\\thas seldom been lower\\n\\t\\t\\tthe courts public approval rating\\n\\t\\t\\thas dropped to a  low\\n\\t\\t\\twith just \\n\\t\\t\\texpressing great confidence\\n\\t\\t\\tits true\\n\\t\\t\\tand its hard to think of anything\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople have less confidence in\\n\\t\\t\\tright now\\n\\t\\t\\taside from maybe the window seats\\n\\t\\t\\tin boeing planes\\n\\t\\t\\tand there are understandable\\n\\t\\t\\treasons for that\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the unpopular decision\\n\\t\\t\\toverturning roe v wade\\n\\t\\t\\tto the fact that onethird\\n\\t\\t\\tof the court was appointed\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes under\\n\\t\\t\\tdubious circumstances\\n\\t\\t\\tby a man who never won\\n\\t\\t\\tthe popular vote\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the past year\\n\\t\\t\\thas also introduced us to\\n\\t\\t\\ta whole new reason\\n\\t\\t\\tto question the courts integrity\\n\\t\\t\\tthanks to a steady drumbeat\\n\\t\\t\\tof stories like these\\n\\t\\t\\tsupreme court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustice clarence thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis facing new allegations he accepted\\n\\t\\t\\tluxurious vacations and gifts\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom wealthy individuals\\n\\t\\t\\tand didnt properly disclose

king salmon lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tand were served multicourse meals\\n\\t\\t\\tof alaskan king crab legs\\n\\t\\t\\tor kobe filet\\n\\t\\t\\tthey also enjoyed wine\\n\\t\\t\\tthat cost  a bottle\\n\\t\\t\\talito denies he did anything wrong\\n\\t\\t\\tand specifically said\\n\\t\\t\\tif there was wine it was certainly\\n\\t\\t\\tnot wine that costs \\n\\t\\t\\twhich i hope is true\\n\\t\\t\\tfor multiple reasons\\n\\t\\t\\tnamely that wine\\n\\t\\t\\tshould never cost \\n\\t\\t\\tbecause wine\\n\\t\\t\\tis not that good a drink\\n\\t\\t\\tthink about the words\\n\\t\\t\\tpeople use to describe good wine\\n\\t\\t\\tcomplex thats just\\n\\t\\t\\ta fancy word for confusing\\n\\t\\t\\tearthy\\n\\t\\t\\tthats literally dirt flavor\\n\\t\\t\\tand smooth\\n\\t\\t\\tyour best compliment is that\\n\\t\\t\\tit didnt fight you on the way down\\n\\t\\t\\tits a bad drink\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the cost of the wine\\n\\t\\t\\twhich again should be zero\\n\\t\\t\\tisnt the point here\\n\\t\\t\\tstories like those have further\\n\\t\\t\\tundermined public trust in the court\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is a big problem\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause its an institution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat relies on respect\\n\\t\\t\\tit cant enforce its own rulings\\n\\t\\t\\tand without public buyin\\n\\t\\t\\tit could theoretically be ignored\\n\\t\\t\\tchief justice roberts himself\\n\\t\\t\\trecently wrote\\n\\t\\t\\tpublic trust is essential\\n\\t\\t\\tnot incidental to our function\\n\\t\\t\\tthese scandals\\n\\t\\t\\tare a huge issue for it\\n\\t\\t\\tgiven that wed thought wed look\\n\\t\\t\\tat how deep this courts problems go\\n\\t\\t\\tand a possible solution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat might go oneninth of the way\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards helping things get better\\n\\t\\t\\tand lets start\\n\\t\\t\\twith a striking fact\\n\\t\\t\\twhen it comes to what ethical rules\\n\\t\\t\\tthe court is required to follow\\n\\t\\t\\tthere basically arent any\\n\\t\\t\\tcongress can impeach a justice\\n\\t\\t\\tin extreme scenarios\\n\\t\\t\\tbut short of that the court\\n\\t\\t\\tessentially regulates itself\\n\\t\\t\\tand that has happened\\n\\t\\t\\tin the past\\n\\t\\t\\tin the  justice abe fortas\\n\\t\\t\\twas involved in a number of scandals\\n\\t\\t\\tincluding taking money\\n\\t\\t\\tto advise a businessman\\n\\t\\t\\twho wound up having\\n\\t\\t\\ta case before the court\\n\\t\\t\\tbut despite the fact that getting paid\\n\\t\\t\\tfor outside work was legal\\n\\t\\t\\tand that fortas both returned the money\\n\\t\\t\\tand recused himself from the case\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation\\n\\t\\t\\the stepped down saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so for the good of the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand just a few weeks later\\n\\t\\t\\tthe us judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges\\n\\t\\t\\twith one tiny exception\\n\\t\\t\\tsee if you can spot it\\n\\t\\t\\tthe united states judicial\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges\\n\\t\\t\\texcept supreme court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees gifts\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor offbench activities\\n\\t\\t\\tthe supreme court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt\\n\\t\\t\\tthat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had\\n\\t\\t\\tand thereve been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the supreme court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it\\n\\t\\t\\tand even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable\\n\\t\\t\\tthe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land\\n\\t\\t\\ttheres no one they can answer to\\n\\t\\t\\tover the years\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules\\n\\t\\t\\ttheyre required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than \\n\\t\\t\\tthat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout ruth bader ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a  opera costume\\n\\t\\t\\tketanji brown

slightly weirdly phrased\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause  worth of dictionaries\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or  regular ones\\n\\t\\t\\tbut while those gifts were disclosed\\n\\t\\t\\tothers havent been\\n\\t\\t\\tscalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand i bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that funsounding visit\\n\\t\\t\\tand as youve already seen\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent\\n\\t\\t\\tremember alitos fishing trip\\n\\t\\t\\twhen it came to light\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didnt think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument\\n\\t\\t\\talito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\the was in what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\n\\t\\t\\tcome on\\n\\t\\t\\talitos considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds\\n\\t\\t\\tand thats the best hes got\\n\\t\\t\\tif you hadnt been in the seat\\n\\t\\t\\tit wouldve been empty samuel\\n\\t\\t\\tthats not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work\\n\\t\\t\\talso its a private jet\\n\\t\\t\\tall the seats are otherwise unoccupied\\n\\t\\t\\tthey dont overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike its the  spirit airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from myrtle beach to vegas\\n\\t\\t\\tand that feels ethically dicey\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad  cases before the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand thats not a oneoff\\n\\t\\t\\tfor years neil gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a  piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he coowned in colorado\\n\\t\\t\\tbut coincidentally just\\n\\t\\t\\tnine days after he was confirmed\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it\\n\\t\\t\\tand while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isnt great\\n\\t\\t\\tcause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\tthe chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nations biggest law firms\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least  supreme court cases\\n\\t\\t\\tand if youre wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now\\n\\t\\t\\tim pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tits the ghost of abe fortas going\\n\\t\\t\\tare you kidding me\\n\\t\\t\\tare you kidding me\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably clarence thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tif youre unfamiliar with his work\\n\\t\\t\\ti envy you\\n\\t\\t\\tbut very quickly\\n\\t\\t\\thes an extreme originalist\\n\\t\\t\\tknown for adopting\\n\\t\\t\\thardright

if youre thinking\\n\\t\\t\\tthats a pretty big purchase\\n\\t\\t\\tfor a supreme court justice\\n\\t\\t\\tto be able to afford about that\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tsupreme court justice\\n\\t\\t\\tclarence thomas\\n\\t\\t\\thas been an rv evangelist\\n\\t\\t\\tfor decades\\n\\t\\t\\ttraveling the country\\n\\t\\t\\tin a  luxury motor coach\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he purchased in \\n\\t\\t\\tafter borrowing more than\\n\\t\\t\\ta quarter of a million dollars\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a wealthy friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut a new report from democrats\\n\\t\\t\\ton the senate finance committee\\n\\t\\t\\talleges thomas friend\\n\\t\\t\\tforgave a substantial amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof that massive loan\\n\\t\\t\\tand nine years later\\n\\t\\t\\this friend forgave all the debt\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sounds like a sweet deal\\n\\t\\t\\tits starting to feel like thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tdoesnt so much have friends\\n\\t\\t\\tas a collection of human atms\\n\\t\\t\\tand his wealthy friends\\n\\t\\t\\twill say there is nothing to see here\\n\\t\\t\\ttheyre just doing for clarence\\n\\t\\t\\twhat they would do for anyone else\\n\\t\\t\\tharlan crow\\n\\t\\t\\tpulled that exact move\\n\\t\\t\\tin a statement harlan

extended\\n\\t\\t\\tto the thomases over the years\\n\\t\\t\\tis no different from the hospitality\\n\\t\\t\\twe have extended\\n\\t\\t\\tto our many other dear friends\\n\\t\\t\\tokay but it is different though\\n\\t\\t\\twhile you may have been friends\\n\\t\\t\\twith clarence thomas for a long time\\n\\t\\t\\tyou didnt start\\n\\t\\t\\tbeing friends with him\\n\\t\\t\\tuntil five years after he was made\\n\\t\\t\\ta supreme court justice\\n\\t\\t\\teach of his four major benefactors\\n\\t\\t\\tappears to have first met thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tafter he ascended\\n\\t\\t\\tto the supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is inherently telling\\n\\t\\t\\teven socially inept high schoolers\\n\\t\\t\\tcan figure that out\\n\\t\\t\\tif brenna jackson and ashton\\n\\t\\t\\tonly start hanging out with you\\n\\t\\t\\tafter you get a job at coldstone\\n\\t\\t\\tits not about you\\n\\t\\t\\tits about the free fucking scoops\\n\\t\\t\\tand thankfully there is a way\\n\\t\\t\\tfor a justice to avoid the appearance\\n\\t\\t\\tof impropriety and that is recusal\\n\\t\\t\\tany justice is required\\n\\t\\t\\tto disqualify themselves\\n\\t\\t\\tin any proceeding\\n\\t\\t\\twhere their impartiality\\n\\t\\t\\tmight reasonably be questioned\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as with everything else\\n\\t\\t\\tyouve seen tonight\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\tits essentially just a suggestion\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices themselves decide\\n\\t\\t\\tif they are able to be impartial\\n\\t\\t\\tand those decisions\\n\\t\\t\\tcannot then be appealed\\n\\t\\t\\teven when it comes to recusals\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas is an outlier\\n\\t\\t\\the almost never recuses\\n\\t\\t\\teven when he clearly should\\n\\t\\t\\ttake one recent case where he had\\n\\t\\t\\ta flagrant conflict of interest\\n\\t\\t\\talbeit not a financial one\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause the court recently\\n\\t\\t\\ttook up a number of appeals\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving cases\\n\\t\\t\\tsurrounding january \\n\\t\\t\\tand as it happens a major cheerleader\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn bidens win\\n\\t\\t\\twas thomas own wife ginni\\n\\t\\t\\tas her texts\\n\\t\\t\\tto thenwhite house chief of staff\\n\\t\\t\\tmark meadows show\\n\\t\\t\\tin one thomas writing quote\\n\\t\\t\\thelp this great president\\n\\t\\t\\tstand firm mark\\n\\t\\t\\tbiden and the left is attempting\\n\\t\\t\\tthe greatest heist of our history\\n\\t\\t\\tand in another\\n\\t\\t\\tjust days the  election\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas writing\\n\\t\\t\\tdo not concede\\n\\t\\t\\ton november \\n\\t\\t\\tmeadows wrote thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tthis is a fight\\n\\t\\t\\tof good versus evil\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas replied\\n\\t\\t\\tthank you needed that\\n\\t\\t\\tthis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now\\n\\t\\t\\tginni thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election\\n\\t\\t\\tbut despite that conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend line\\n\\t\\t\\tginni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is a bit weird\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot\\n\\t\\t\\tits a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife virginia\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world\\n\\t\\t\\ti love to spend time with my wife\\n\\t\\t\\twhos my best friend in the world\\n\\t\\t\\ti love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride virginia\\n\\t\\t\\twhos a gift from god and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world\\n\\t\\t\\tokay first\\n\\t\\t\\tif ginni is indeed a gift from god\\n\\t\\t\\ti guess its nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat clarence thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire\\n\\t\\t\\tbut also itd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either ginni thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt\\n\\t\\t\\tor shes clarences best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isnt hers\\n\\t\\t\\tand that is rough theres going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip\\n\\t\\t\\tbut the fact is a justices wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election\\n\\t\\t\\tyet in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving january \\n\\t\\t\\tthomas didnt recuse himself\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether white house files\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of ginnis texts\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the january  committee\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret\\n\\t\\t\\tand if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest\\n\\t\\t\\ti honestly dont know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is\\n\\t\\t\\tthe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause im not saying that thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts\\n\\t\\t\\this opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht\\n\\t\\t\\tthat doesnt mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thavent had a real impact on him\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause for years\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas repeatedly talked about money\\n\\t\\t\\tin the  he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\tmore than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\n\\t\\t\\tbut unfortunately for him\\n\\t\\t\\tthats exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta supreme court justice pays\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under \\n\\t\\t\\tand hes been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly\\n\\t\\t\\tthe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay\\n\\t\\t\\tits not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle\\n\\t\\t\\tyou sure about that\\n\\t\\t\\tcause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures\\n\\t\\t\\tmost bloggers do that for free\\n\\t\\t\\tand they dont get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone elses law\\n\\t\\t\\tit was right around that time\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts\\n\\t\\t\\tthat thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta republican member of congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat unless it gave supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise quote\\n\\t\\t\\tone or more will leave soon\\n\\t\\t\\tmaybe in the next year\\n\\t\\t\\tthat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters\\n\\t\\t\\tas that lawmaker thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\this importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount\\n\\t\\t\\twe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly\\n\\t\\t\\tunfortunately for thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices salaries havent been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable\\n\\t\\t\\tand in recent years hes seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck\\n\\t\\t\\tright now what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\tgoodness i think its plenty\\n\\t\\t\\tits not quite where you are\\n\\t\\t\\tbut its\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\ti have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tmy wife and i are doing fine\\n\\t\\t\\twe dont live extravagantly\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine\\n\\t\\t\\theres a fun fact for you\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early june of \\n\\t\\t\\tguess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month\\n\\t\\t\\ton harlan crows\\n\\t\\t\\tindonesian yacht trip\\n\\t\\t\\tthat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand fingers crossed\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it\\n\\t\\t\\tbasically what im suggesting is\\n\\t\\t\\tits not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid thomas to change his views\\n\\t\\t\\tits that they like his views\\n\\t\\t\\tso theyre paying for him not to leave\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is different but not better\\n\\t\\t\\tand if that was their plan\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further\\n\\t\\t\\tin his concurrence in the dobbs case\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control and gay marriage\\n\\t\\t\\tand despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which hes evolved\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause remember that chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that i mentioned earlier\\n\\t\\t\\t years ago\\n\\t\\t\\tthomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tchevrons protections\\n\\t\\t\\tbut since then\\n\\t\\t\\ttheres been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the koch organization\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know clarences vacation friends\\n\\t\\t\\tand a few years ago thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that hed determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all\\n\\t\\t\\twhat caused that change of heart\\n\\t\\t\\ti dont know\\n\\t\\t\\twas it  years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin rightwing money and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned\\n\\t\\t\\twe cant say for sure but we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together cant we\\n\\t\\t\\tready lets do that one two three\\n\\t\\t\\tyes its because of the money\\n\\t\\t\\tshit sorry i thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth\\n\\t\\t\\ti know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton clarence thomas tonight\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisnt just about his integrity\\n\\t\\t\\tits about the courts\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom the beginning america\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the threefifths compromise\\n\\t\\t\\tand while weve shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the supreme court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics\\n\\t\\t\\tit retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony\\n\\t\\t\\twe put the justices on a pedestal\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards\\n\\t\\t\\tin their confirmation hearings\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow theyll rule on hotbutton issues\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die\\n\\t\\t\\twe dont treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are which is people\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed like anybody else\\n\\t\\t\\tbut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break\\n\\t\\t\\tand right now it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tsupreme court is at a breaking point\\n\\t\\t\\tand there are small ways to fix that\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real enforceable ethics code\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand honestly if it were up to me\\n\\t\\t\\ttheyd also be dressed not in robes\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as walmart greeters\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize theyre not magic\\n\\t\\t\\ttheyre humans like everyone else\\n\\t\\t\\tbut if were not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that\\n\\t\\t\\tif were going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps its time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades\\n\\t\\t\\tand that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that i mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece\\n\\t\\t\\tclarence thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand hes never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job\\n\\t\\t\\thes said its not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief\\n\\t\\t\\tso what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief\\n\\t\\t\\ti think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause justice thomas we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight\\n\\t\\t\\twe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t million a year\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the supreme court

makes sense im getting out of here where you going at you know duane tubman next door hell yeah tubman his father just died hey you give him my deepest condolences i feel like i should go over and pay my respects or something it always helps to be on good terms with your neighbor okay you know what i just got another glimpse honestly that one was on purpose sorry so sorry hey larry thank you so much for coming of course hey this is what neighbors do right we have each others backs come on by the way i was really touched by what you did in atlanta coming from a tubman i take that as a great compliment okay anyway very sorry to hear about your father thank you well fatherinlaw but thank you really i thought it was your father no its lorraines fatherinlaw yeah thats a little better well its my fatherinlaw lts a loss duane of course its a loss but you know its not your dad larry its a human being yeah of course i know that im just trying to delineate the differences between a father and a fatherinlaw its a very sad thing your dads still alive yeah there you go yeah thats a gift and you know its like if you have im sorry did you say a dog yeah a dog say your dog dies thats one thing thats terrible but if your friends dog dies its not quite the same but anyway is your wife around lorraine is she here can i talk to her maybe we just let her rest will you tell her how sorry i am about her dad are you because it doesnt really sound like it between you and me my condolences arent quite as deep as the average persons im picking that up its like people telling each other they love them that kind of thing sorrys in that kind of category theyre the same theyre interchangeable really nobody means it i love you nobody means it of course people mean it nobody means it but anyway are you sure lorraines not around im positive got enough food and everything can i get you some bagels and lox i think were good do you like a bagel there are a lot of people here im picking up on that cue of course actually larry theres one thing i wanted to talk to you about the lemon tree the lemon tree yeah along the fence its back there its given us so many lemons over the years the one that hangs over my yard the roots theyre damaging my pipes so we got to do something about this tree dont worry about the research ill look into it ill get an estimate well sit down and well split the cost of the tree maintenance and we can keep enjoying these lemons split the cost of the tree duane i mean you know come on its your tree its on your side its our tree its not our tree let me get this right so its our tree when you want lemons and its my tree when we have to take care of it and maintain it i want some lemons i dont want lemons you think i need lemons in my life i can go the rest of my life without touching a lemon no lemons for life i put it on a piece of fish whatre you gonna substitute for lemons a grapefruit youre gonna put grapefruit on fish i put grapefruits on fish when i havent actually put it on but ive thought about it really yeah my point is lemons are a fungible citrus just look around the room weve suffered a loss you lost your fatherinlaw id appreciate you stepping up and being a neighbor and paying for half of this tree maintenance thank you for coming out had i known that it was his fatherinlaw i never wouldve gone to the house in the first place and this lemon thing by the way you know hes a descendant of harriet tubman well youd think his ancestors would be ashamed of him no the lemons drop what am i supposed to do throw em back over the fence

about as selfish as they come and you larry you have no heart you have no soul what if i was maimed by a coyote what would you do then huh would you continue playing certainly i would give you more

curious i mean if somebody told a joke do you think you have the capacity to laugh i guess it would depend on the joke larry so a funny joke could make you laugh and provide some temporary relief in a very painful time got it okay just curious so the invoice i got the invoice from the tree service they had to remove the stump too if we could just split that down the middle okay come on duane they had to remove the stump for eating a couple of lemons a month and thats how much it costs to get rid of a tree duane i got to tell you something okay this is very untubmanlike behavior thats the second time with tubmans i dont know what you mean l dont think that your great aunt harriet would condone this so what kind of person was she larry well she was the kind of person who smuggled slaves from the south to the north and didnt charge them really you know what harriet tubman would have done she would have come over to my house with a big basket of lemons larry darling take as many lemons

in the last two months from ron desantis ending his campaign to nikki haley losing the nevada primary to none of these candidates but the story im most sad to have missed concerned the sudden mania around a hole shaped like a rat on a chicago street or rat hole as it became known which probably peaked with this you knew it was inevitable a chicago rat hole wedding wedding bells on saturday at whats become chicagos hottest tourist attraction the chicago rat hole raj and his partner looked at a lot of chicago landmarks for their wedding until nine days ago when he saw the story of the chicago rat hole we were viewing a lot of different venues a lot of different big monuments in chicago and finally we looked at each other and we were like lets get married at the rat hole yes say what you will that marriage is gonna last forever nothing says a relationship is solid like waiting until nine fucking days before your wedding to pick a venue then looking into each others eyes and both saying lets get married at the rat hole that is true love right there the holes emergence as a tourist attraction became a bit of a nuisance for neighbors though which may explain why shortly before that wedding this happened at some point today or yesterday someone filled in chicagos most famous concrete attraction what were your feelings when you came to the rat hole and you saw it was filled in with concrete i dont understand why everyones trying to block our good time exactly shes right let us enjoy one thing just one thing filling in the rat hole is a grave injustice both figuratively and literally id love to spend this entire episode talking about rat holes god knows ive done it before but theres more to catch up on in russia putin has been busy one of his most prominent critics alexei navalny died in a siberian prison this week for reasons any idiot can figure out making it a bit awkward that last week noted idiot tucker carlson sat down with putin for a fawning interview in which he failed to meaningfully challenge him tucker was so docile even putin later made fun of him i thought hed be aggressive asking these socalled sharp questions i wasnt simply ready for it i wanted it because it would give me a chance to respond equally sharply which in my view would give specificity to our entire conversation but he chose a different tactic frankly speaking i didnt get complete pleasure from this interview theres embarrassing and theres getting roasted by putin for being a lap dog embarrassing also why on earth did he think thered be sharp questions if whoever prepped putin for that interview said anything other than youre about to talk to the dumbest brooks brother so feel free to take a nap they should be fired meanwhile in the middle east israel continued its assault on gaza with over palestinians now dead most of them women and children this week saw attacks in rafah the city that stands as the last refuge for gazan civilians and yet the us refuses to curtail military aid to israel instead offering tepid rebukes like biden saying israels actions are over the top while the white house leaks that privately the presidents very upset part of what the president is saying according to people whove heard him make these comments is that netanyahu is quote giving him hell that hes impossible to deal with were also told on three at least three instances the president referred to netanyahu as an ahole careful there joe what if bibi hears you nothing shames the guy comfortable with bombing hospitals and refugee camps like knowing that miles away an is muttering words under his breath next biden is going to whisper what a dick into a seashell and toss it into the ocean biden has reportedly said much worse which american tv danced around but arabiclanguage al jazeera delivered the quote in full and were not going to translate this for you but youll know the phrase when you hear it bad fucking guy yeah biden apparently called netanyahu a bad fucking guy you should be allowed to say that about netanyahu uncensored on american tv because i guarantee its coming out the mouths of gazans and the families of the hostages nonstop right now the presidents likely opponent in november has been taking a break between court dates and accumulating massive financial penalties to offer his own plans for international relations first saying that if nato members dont pay their bills which isnt a thing hed encourage russia to do whatever the hell they want then he suggested aid to ukraine should actually be a loan then got distracted then distracted again from his original distraction why should you just hand it over to em do it as a form of a loan i do that with athletes like a professional golfer who i think is very good they dont have any money but they have a lot of talent ill say heres the deal i did it with a number of people heres the deal what i wanna do professional golfer play golf i play very nice did you see the picture of me with the stomach out to here so what i do is im putting up today a picture of me actually what i actually look like hitting a ball smashing the fricking ball and youll see quite i wouldnt say slim i wouldnt say slim but not bad but the ball does go far i would say it goes about nine times further than biden can hit it what i havent watched trump speak in so long i forgot how jampacked with nonsense every sentence is its the little details like the way he suddenly yelled hand it over to them as if a ghost jabbed him in the ribs midsentence i dont want to be overdramatic but the idea of watching clips of him talking every week for the next year makes me want to book a trip on the next titan submersible and i know no one watching this needs a reminder that we have a long grim election year ahead of us but keep in mind its only february we need to pace ourselves or were going to get burned out and want to crawl into a small hole and wait for it to be over though i will say if that does happen i know a pretty good hole in chicago thats apparently available and now this and now chuck grassley celebrates his favorite holiday unfortunately this is a little bit like the movie groundhogs day some days constituent correspondence may seem like the movie groundhog day immigration is becoming the groundhog day of the united states senate so its kind of groundhog day once again yesterday we also had groundhogs day my first chart is a depiction of punxsutawney phil in the past i have compared this constant repetition to a film called groundhog day starring bill murray where bill murrays character relives the same day over and over again next to me is this chart from the movie groundhog day groundhog day is also the title of a famous film starring bill murray so i have another picture for you of phil and bill driving along moving on our main story tonight concerns the courts the dignified palaces of justice which during covid brought us spectacular moments like this mr ponton i believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings it is and i dont know how to remove it ive got my assistant here shes trying to but im prepared to go forward with it im here live im not a cat perfect you know a hearings off to a shaky start when a lawyer has to clarify that he is not a cat and i did not want him to uncat himself there i wanted that man to spend the rest of the hearing as a photorealistic kitten looking like he witnessed a double homicide were going to talk about the supreme court which is set to have a monumental year not only will it take on cases concerning the availability of mifepristone and whether trumps immune from prosecution for his role in january its also considering one case centering on something called chevron deference it sounds like the title of a spy novel that youd burn through at an airport but its a vitally important legal precedent that says that when there is ambiguity in the letter of a law courts should defer to regulatory agencies expertise do you like it when the epa regulates pollution or the fda regulates drugs much of their ability to do that comes from chevron deference and if the court guts it itll be much easier for private industries to block government regulation so this is gonna be a huge year for a court that has seldom been more powerful and yet respect for it has seldom been lower the courts public approval rating has dropped to a low with just expressing great confidence its true and its hard to think of anything people have less confidence in right now aside from maybe the window seats in boeing planes and there are understandable reasons for that from the unpopular decision overturning roe v wade to the fact that onethird of the court was appointed sometimes under dubious circumstances by a man who never won the popular vote but the past year has also introduced us to a whole new reason to question the courts integrity thanks to a steady drumbeat of stories like these supreme court justice clarence thomas is facing new allegations he accepted luxurious vacations and gifts from wealthy individuals and didnt properly disclose them politico reported justice neil gorsuch sold property he owned to the head of a major law firm justice samuel alito defended himself after he didnt report a luxury trip to alaska and a private jet flight the report details that in july of that year they stayed at the king salmon lodge and were served multicourse meals of alaskan king crab legs or kobe filet they also enjoyed wine that cost a bottle alito denies he did anything wrong and specifically said if there was wine it was certainly not wine that costs which i hope is true for multiple reasons namely that wine should never cost because wine is not that good a drink think about the words people use to describe good wine complex thats just a fancy word for confusing earthy thats literally dirt flavor and smooth your best compliment is that it didnt fight you on the way down its a bad drink but the cost of the wine which again should be zero isnt the point here stories like those have further undermined public trust in the court which is a big problem because its an institution that relies on respect it cant enforce its own rulings and without public buyin it could theoretically be ignored chief justice roberts himself recently wrote public trust is essential not incidental to our function these scandals are a huge issue for it given that wed thought wed look at how deep this courts problems go and a possible solution that might go oneninth of the way towards helping things get better and lets start with a striking fact when it comes to what ethical rules the court is required to follow there basically arent any congress can impeach a justice in extreme scenarios but short of that the court essentially regulates itself and that has happened in the past in the justice abe fortas was involved in a number of scandals including taking money to advise a businessman who wound up having a case before the court but despite the fact that getting paid for outside work was legal and that fortas both returned the money and recused himself from the case the mere appearance of impropriety caused lawmakers of both parties to call for his resignation he stepped down saying that he was doing so for the good of the court and just a few weeks later the us judicial conference unveiled a new ethics policy for federal judges with one tiny exception see if you can spot it the united states judicial judicial conference today issued a code of ethics which forbids all federal judges except supreme court justices from accepting fees gifts or compensation of any kind for offbench activities the supreme court justices were exempt that new rule solved every problem except for the one they just had and thereve been multiple tweaks to the code of ethics over the years with the one constant being that the supreme court justices are not covered by it and even laws that apply to them are basically unenforceable the argument is that because they are the highest court in the land theres no one they can answer to over the years the justices have noted that they voluntarily follow certain rules theyre required to report any gifts worth more than that is how we learned about ruth bader ginsburg receiving a opera costume ketanji brown jackson receiving a floral arrangement from oprah worth and antonin scalia receiving two firearms and worth of dictionaries which is slightly weirdly phrased because worth of dictionaries could either mean one very luxurious dictionary or regular ones but while those gifts were disclosed others havent been scalia had a habit of not disclosing trips that other people paid for and died while staying for free at the hunting lodge of a business executive whose company had recently had a case before the court and i bet that executive was very glad he got the ruling before that funsounding visit and as youve already seen some justices have run with that precedent remember alitos fishing trip when it came to light he said that he didnt think the rules required disclosing it and attempted to justify the free private jet flight with a laughable argument alito explaining that on that private jet flight he was in what would otherwise have been an unoccupied seat come on alitos considered one of the sharpest conservative legal minds and thats the best hes got if you hadnt been in the seat it wouldve been empty samuel thats not so much a defense of your behavior as it is an explanation of how seats work also its a private jet all the seats are otherwise unoccupied they dont overbook them like its the spirit airlines flight from myrtle beach to vegas and that feels ethically dicey even before you learn that one of his hosts on that trip was a hedge fund manager whose companies have since had cases before the court and thats not a oneoff for years neil gorsuch had been trying unsuccessfully to sell a piece of property that he coowned in colorado but coincidentally just nine days after he was confirmed he managed to sell it and while he did disclose that sale he left the identity of the purchaser blank on the form which isnt great cause it turned out to be the chief executive of one of the nations biggest law firms which has since been involved in at least supreme court cases and if youre wondering what that weird sound is right now im pretty sure its the ghost of abe fortas going are you kidding me are you kidding me but the biggest offender on the court is unquestionably clarence thomas if youre unfamiliar with his work i envy you but very quickly hes an extreme originalist known for adopting hardright positions years before other justices come around to them from overturning gun laws to undermining the voting rights act hes also questioned whether poor people have a right to a lawyer saying the constitution only guarantees you the right to hire a lawyer not to have one provided for you and he once said that black civil rights leaders bitch bitch bitch moan and moan whine and whine and sure why cant the people fighting for basic equality just have the chill goodtime vibes that we all associate with clarence fucking thomas hes so fun to be around ask almost any woman whos ever worked for him for years there have been stories about thomas accepting lavish gifts but things escalated recently with a series of propublica investigations revealing thomas relationship with these four conservative billionaires the report says the four moguls collectively treated thomas to destination vacations private jet flights plus an additional eight by helicopter a dozen vip passes to professional and college sporting events two stays at luxury resorts in florida and jamaica and one standing invitation to an uberexclusive golf club the dollar value likely in the millions just one of those vacations was a nineday indonesian superyacht voyage that if hed paid for it himself could have exceeded over half a million dollars and the way propublica tracked down some of those trips is pretty great the host of that indonesian vacation and multiple others was harlan crow a billionaire who has given millions to efforts to move the law and the judiciary to the right crow liked to give out commemorative polo shirts for the trips that he took people on propublica started looking at the shirts thomas was wearing in photos which helped them uncover some of these trips journalism is a crapshoot sometimes you spend weeks hunting down leads painstakingly building a timeline other times your target just posts a photo of himself on facebook wearing a tshirt that says secret undeclared yacht vacation and gives the whole game away those reporters also tracked down photos and cards that thomas wife ginni sent to friends to commemorate their trips with fun captions like five couples ready for river rafting the sokols took four lucky couples to the first nebraska footbal misspelled game of the season and this photo of a trump administration attorney and his wife captioned mark and tricia paoletta sang a special tribute to clarence they created and every single one of those photos looks like it was on the mood board for get out but wait cause im still not done they also found this photorealistic painting that harlan crow commissioned of one of those vacations featuring him thomas leonard leo of the conservative federalist society and a statue of a native american man seemingly praying for lightning to strike this exact spot but if youre thinking that that is the worst piece of art harlan crow owns you are mistaken published reports say dallas tycoon harlan crows controversial collection includes hitlers notorious autobiography mein kampf signed by hitler oil paintings by hitler and linen napkins embroidered with the nazi swastika the collection is housed at crows mansion in dallas i cant get over the collection of nazi memorabilia said one guest who saw the nazi treasure trove you sort of just gasp when you walk into the room yeah i bet you do because that is a bit of a red flag specifically this red flag crow says his controversial artifacts are part of a collection meant to preserve a part of our history and to understand how we all got here and im guessing his guests ask that exact question when they see his signed copy of mein kampf for the first time how the fuck did i get here though bad news for harlan about at least one of his hitler paintings an expert has since deemed it definitely not authentic which i guess he probably shouldve seen coming as it was signed a hitler and not the hitler crows also repeatedly flown thomas out on his jet for trips to the bohemian grove the california retreat for the rich and powerful where he and the koch brothers apparently developed a bond here is thomas with one of them and ken burns for some fucking reason thomas has also incidentally attended koch donor events at least twice serving as a fundraising draw for an organization that regularly brings cases before the court his excuse for not reporting any of this was that he sought guidance from my colleagues and others and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends was not reportable and while it is true the judicial guidelines have an exception for personal hospitality experts will point out that means dinner at someones house not a ninedayall expensespaid yacht trip a pretty good rule of thumb is if it could be a prize on the price is right its not personal hospitality and thomas has received more than just hospitality anyway in one of harlan crows companies bought a string of properties in savannah including thomas childhood home where his mother still lives crow also reportedly paid for two years of private school for thomas grandnephew who apparently thomas has raised as a son and which based on the tuition rates at the time amounted to roughly neither of those were disclosed at the time either and it gets pretty hard to square the lavish vacations the real estate the tuition with thomas insistence that hes an iconoclastic voice for the little guy in appearances like this one from two years ago where he thanked the people whod shown up to support him during his confirmation hearing the regular people showed up and it was always us against the elites and thats the way it has been for the last years ive been in public life us against the elites i get it so the destination vacations were just part of your us versus the elites plot right lull them into a false sense of security then presumably on the vacation vive la rvolution i love it what a plan but that sounds like horseshit even before you see that this is how that talk started im sure you and all of us want to join harlan thank harlan crow and his family for making this wonderful facility available to us i know harlan hates that i knew we had to thats why i wouldnt say it id like to keep that friendship i bet you would im sure friendship is the thing that you like the most about knowing harlan crow not the lavish yacht trips or the private jet flights the simple human companionship of an aging nazi napkin collector but perhaps the item that perfectly sums up the distance between thomas regularguy persona and his highend tastes is his motor home it is his prize possession he even showed it off during his minutes interview one of his passions is this motor home that he and his wife use to explore the united states in their downtime do you find this relaxing yeah its away from the meanness that you see in washington and you get here with just the regular folks and its so pleasant i can see that people in washington can be so mean cant they ive heard some even make decisions in landmark court cases that loosen gun regulations limit affirmative action and strip women of their constitutional right to an abortion so i get the impulse to want to get outta town to avoid those fucking sociopaths thomas loves his motor home so much he can be a bit of a snob if asked inaccurately about it one of you enjoys traveling crosscountry with your spouse in a rv whos that thats technically incorrect is it not an rv it is a motor coach is that bigger than an rv it could be but it is a better vehicle than an rv an rv is normally built on a light truck chassis a motor coach is a tour bus i mean its old but its really nice honestly if thomas hadnt caused so much human misery him liking big comfy trucks that go vroomvroom would be genuinely charming every man in his has picked a vehicle that occupies way too much space in his brain and heart some like trains that go choochoo some like boats that go glubglub and others love motor coaches based on a nonlighttruck chassis im not saying these men love their vehicles more than their families its just its easier for them to say i prefer o scale trains because historically thats what this countrys finest model trains have been since the than im proud of you son but about that bus it is apparently the rollsroyce of motor coaches a custom prevost marathon or as thomas himself once put it a condo on wheels and if youre thinking thats a pretty big purchase for a supreme court justice to be able to afford about that supreme court justice clarence thomas has been an rv evangelist for decades traveling the country in a luxury motor coach that he purchased in after borrowing more than a quarter of a million dollars from a wealthy friend but a new report from democrats on the senate finance committee alleges thomas friend forgave a substantial amount of that massive loan and nine years later his friend forgave all the debt that sounds like a sweet deal its starting to feel like thomas doesnt so much have friends as a collection of human atms and his wealthy friends will say there is nothing to see here theyre just doing for clarence what they would do for anyone else harlan crow pulled that exact move in a statement harlan crow the dallas real estate billionaire who picks up the tabs for the trips says he and thomas have been friends since the hospitality we have extended to the thomases over the years is no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends okay but it is different though while you may have been friends with clarence thomas for a long time you didnt start being friends with him until five years after he was made a supreme court justice each of his four major benefactors appears to have first met thomas after he ascended to the supreme court which is inherently telling even socially inept high schoolers can figure that out if brenna jackson and ashton only start hanging out with you after you get a job at coldstone its not about you its about the free fucking scoops and thankfully there is a way for a justice to avoid the appearance of impropriety and that is recusal any justice is required to disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned but as with everything else youve seen tonight for the supreme court its essentially just a suggestion the justices themselves decide if they are able to be impartial and those decisions cannot then be appealed even when it comes to recusals thomas is an outlier he almost never recuses even when he clearly should take one recent case where he had a flagrant conflict of interest albeit not a financial one because the court recently took up a number of appeals involving cases surrounding january and as it happens a major cheerleader to overturn bidens win was thomas own wife ginni as her texts to thenwhite house chief of staff mark meadows show in one thomas writing quote help this great president stand firm mark biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history and in another just days the election thomas writing do not concede on november meadows wrote thomas this is a fight of good versus evil thomas replied thank you needed that this plus a conversation with my best friend just now ginni thomas looks exactly like a person who would try to speak to the manager about a presidential election but despite that conversation with my best friend line ginni insists she never talked to her husband about the election challenges which is a bit weird because he says this a lot its a particular honor to be here with my wife virginia who is totally my best friend in the world i love to spend time with my wife whos my best friend in the world i love being here with my bride virginia whos a gift from god and my best friend in the whole world okay first if ginni is indeed a gift from god i guess its nice that clarence thomas got at least one gift from someone who is not a billionaire but also itd seem that either ginni thomas was keeping her husband up to date on her ongoing coup attempt or shes clarences best friend but he isnt hers and that is rough theres going to be a lot of awkward silences on their next motor coach trip but the fact is a justices wife inserted herself into efforts to overturn the last election yet in multiple cases involving january thomas didnt recuse himself even in one concerning whether white house files which could have contained more of ginnis texts had to be handed over to the january committee thomas was the lone dissenter saying that they should remain secret and if that is not a conflict of interest i honestly dont know what one is the fundamental corruption here might be bigger than anything one recusal could cover because im not saying that thomas is only voting the way he is because of the trips and the gifts his opinions were horrible before he ever set foot on a yacht that doesnt mean those billionaires havent had a real impact on him because for years thomas repeatedly talked about money in the he told a reporter he planned to be rich and said that means more than just a few hundred thousand dollars a year but unfortunately for him thats exactly what being a supreme court justice pays just under and hes been pretty vocal about his dissatisfaction with that sometimes even publicly the job is not worth doing for what they pay its not worth doing for the grief but it is worth doing for the principle you sure about that cause your job is writing opinions in a bathrobe and it pays six figures most bloggers do that for free and they dont get to enjoy seeing their worst takes becoming everyone elses law it was right around that time in the early aughts that thomas reportedly said to a republican member of congress that unless it gave supreme court justices a pay raise quote one or more will leave soon maybe in the next year that set off alarm bells in conservative quarters as that lawmaker thomas spoke to recalls it his importance as a conservative was paramount we wanted to make sure he felt comfortable in his job and he was being paid properly unfortunately for thomas justices salaries havent been raised beyond inflation since then but it may not be a coincidence that a handful of billionaires have suddenly stepped in to make sure that thomas was never anything less than extremely comfortable and in recent years hes seemed much less worried about his paycheck right now what is the compensation of a justice of the supreme court goodness i think its plenty its not quite where you are but its i have no my wife and i are doing fine we dont live extravagantly but we are fine heres a fun fact for you that was in early june of guess where he was at the end of that month on harlan crows indonesian yacht trip that is the comfortable laugh of a man looking forward to a free trip and fingers crossed a free shirt to go with it basically what im suggesting is its not that these billionaires have paid thomas to change his views its that they like his views so theyre paying for him not to leave which is different but not better and if that was their plan it has worked thomas is at the heart of the new conservative supermajority on the court and has plans to go further in his concurrence in the dobbs case he said the court should reconsider previous erroneous rulings on sodomy birth control and gay marriage and despite being known for the consistency of his views there is one key issue on which hes evolved because remember that chevron deference that i mentioned earlier years ago thomas wrote a majority opinion that expanded chevrons protections but since then theres been a massive conservative push to get rid of chevron led by the koch organization you know clarences vacation friends and a few years ago thomas renounced his earlier decision writing that hed determined that the doctrine is unconstitutional after all what caused that change of heart i dont know was it years of marinating in rightwing money and vacationing with businessmen who could massively profit from it being overturned we cant say for sure but we can all think it together cant we ready lets do that one two three yes its because of the money shit sorry i thought it so hard it came out of my mouth i know we focused a lot on clarence thomas tonight but this story isnt just about his integrity its about the courts from the beginning america like most countries was built on polite fictions by men who could somehow hold in their heads the idea that all men were created equal at the same time that they were drawing up the threefifths compromise and while weve shed a lot of those fictions we still cling to the idea of the supreme court as a body separate and apart from politics it retains a certain amount of mystique and ceremony we put the justices on a pedestal and let them wear robes like wizards in their confirmation hearings they pretend to have no idea how theyll rule on hotbutton issues and we all have to pretend to believe them before we appoint them to a job that they can hold until they die we dont treat them like what they are which is people who can be motivated by ideology and greed like anybody else but polite fictions can only be bent so far before they break and right now it feels like the supreme court is at a breaking point and there are small ways to fix that from a real enforceable ethics code to term limits to even potentially expanding the court and honestly if it were up to me theyd also be dressed not in robes but as walmart greeters to emphasize theyre not magic theyre humans like everyone else but if were not going to do any of that if were going to keep the bar of accountability this low perhaps its time to exploit that low bar the same way billionaires have successfully done for decades and that finally brings us to the solution that i mentioned at the start of this piece clarence thomas is arguably the most consequential justice on the court and hes never really seemed to like the job hes said its not worth doing for the grief so what if he could keep the luxury perks that he clearly enjoys without having to endure all of that grief i think there might actually be a way to do that because justice thomas we have a special offer for you tonight we are prepared to offer you million a year for the rest of your life if you simply agree to leave the supreme court immediately and never come back it is that

further\\n\\t\\t\\tundermined public trust in the court,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is a big problem.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause it's an institution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat relies on respect.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt can't enforce its own rulings.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd without public buy-in,\\n\\t\\t\\tit could theoretically be ignored.\\n\\t\\t\\tChief Justice Roberts himself\\n\\t\\t\\trecently wrote:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Public trust is essential,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot incidental, to our function\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThese scandals\\n\\t\\t\\tare a huge issue for it.\\n\\t\\t\\tGiven that, we'd thought we'd look\\n\\t\\t\\tat how deep this court's problems go,\\n\\t\\t\\tand a possible solution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat might go one-ninth of the way\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards helping things get better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd let's start\\n\\t\\t\\twith a striking fact.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it comes to what ethical rules\\n\\t\\t\\tthe court is required to follow,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere basically aren't any.\\n\\t\\t\\tCongress can impeach a justice\\n\\t\\t\\tin extreme scenarios,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut short of that, the court\\n\\t\\t\\tessentially regulates itself.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that has happened\\n\\t\\t\\tin the past.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the '60s, Justice Abe Fortas\\n\\t\\t\\twas involved in a number of scandals,\\n\\t\\t\\tincluding taking money\\n\\t\\t\\tto advise a businessman\\n\\t\\t\\twho wound up having\\n\\t\\t\\ta case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut despite the fact that getting paid\\n\\t\\t\\tfor outside work was legal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that Fortas both returned the money\\n\\t\\t\\tand recused himself from the case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White

dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the

they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls

it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should

is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority

But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.
