        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

further\\n\\t\\t\\tundermined public trust in the court,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich is a big problem.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause it's an institution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat relies on respect.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt can't enforce its own rulings.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd without public buy-in,\\n\\t\\t\\tit could theoretically be ignored.\\n\\t\\t\\tChief Justice Roberts himself\\n\\t\\t\\trecently wrote:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Public trust is essential,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot incidental, to our function\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThese scandals\\n\\t\\t\\tare a huge issue for it.\\n\\t\\t\\tGiven that, we'd thought we'd look\\n\\t\\t\\tat how deep this court's problems go,\\n\\t\\t\\tand a possible solution\\n\\t\\t\\tthat might go one-ninth of the way\\n\\t\\t\\ttowards helping things get better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd let's start\\n\\t\\t\\twith a striking fact.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it comes to what ethical rules\\n\\t\\t\\tthe court is required to follow,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere basically aren't any.\\n\\t\\t\\tCongress can impeach a justice\\n\\t\\t\\tin extreme scenarios,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut short of that, the court\\n\\t\\t\\tessentially regulates itself.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that has happened\\n\\t\\t\\tin the past.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the '60s, Justice Abe Fortas\\n\\t\\t\\twas involved in a number of scandals,\\n\\t\\t\\tincluding taking money\\n\\t\\t\\tto advise a businessman\\n\\t\\t\\twho wound up having\\n\\t\\t\\ta case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut despite the fact that getting paid\\n\\t\\t\\tfor outside work was legal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that Fortas both returned the money\\n\\t\\t\\tand recused himself from the case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very quickly,\\n\\t\\t\\the's an extreme originalist,\\n\\t\\t\\tknown for adopting\\n\\t\\t\\thard-right positions\\n\\t\\t\\tyears before other\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices come around to them,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom overturning gun laws,\\n\\t\\t\\tto undermining the Voting Rights Act.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's also questioned whether\\n\\t\\t\\tpoor people have a right to a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying the constitution only guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White

is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the

reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave

it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure.

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.

case,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe mere appearance of impropriety\\n\\t\\t\\tcaused lawmakers of both parties\\n\\t\\t\\tto call for his resignation.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe stepped down, saying that he was\\n\\t\\t\\tdoing so \\\"for the good of the court\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd just a few weeks later,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe U.S. judicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\tunveiled a new ethics policy\\n\\t\\t\\tfor federal judges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWith one tiny exception.\\n\\t\\t\\tSee if you can spot it.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe United States judicial,\\n\\t\\t\\tjudicial conference\\n\\t\\t\\ttoday issued a code of ethics\\n\\t\\t\\twhich forbids all federal judges,\\n\\t\\t\\texcept Supreme Court justices,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom accepting fees, gifts,\\n\\t\\t\\tor compensation of any kind\\n\\t\\t\\tfor off-bench activities.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\twere exempt.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat new rule solved every problem\\n\\t\\t\\texcept for the one they just had.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there've been multiple tweaks\\n\\t\\t\\tto the code of ethics over the years,\\n\\t\\t\\twith the one constant being\\n\\t\\t\\tthat the Supreme Court justices\\n\\t\\t\\tare not covered by it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd even laws that apply to them\\n\\t\\t\\tare basically unenforceable.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe argument is that because\\n\\t\\t\\tthey are the highest court in the land,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's no one they can answer to.\\n\\t\\t\\tOver the years,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe justices have noted that they\\n\\t\\t\\tvoluntarily follow certain rules.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey're required to report\\n\\t\\t\\tany gifts worth more than $480.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is how we learned\\n\\t\\t\\tabout Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a $4,500 opera costume,\\n\\t\\t\\tKetanji Brown Jackson\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving a floral arrangement\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom Oprah worth $1,200,\\n\\t\\t\\tand Antonin Scalia\\n\\t\\t\\treceiving \\\"two firearms\\n\\t\\t\\tand $950 worth of dictionaries\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is slightly weirdly phrased.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause \\\"$950 worth of dictionaries\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tcould either mean one very luxurious\\n\\t\\t\\tdictionary or 120 regular ones.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut while those gifts were disclosed,\\n\\t\\t\\tothers haven't been.\\n\\t\\t\\tScalia had a habit of not disclosing\\n\\t\\t\\ttrips that other people paid for,\\n\\t\\t\\tand died while staying for free\\n\\t\\t\\tat the hunting lodge\\n\\t\\t\\tof a business executive\\n\\t\\t\\twhose company had recently\\n\\t\\t\\thad a case before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd I bet that executive\\n\\t\\t\\twas very glad he got the ruling\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore that fun-sounding visit.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd as you've already seen,\\n\\t\\t\\tsome justices\\n\\t\\t\\thave run with that precedent.\\n\\t\\t\\tRemember Alito's fishing trip?\\n\\t\\t\\tWhen it came to light,\\n\\t\\t\\the said that he didn't think\\n\\t\\t\\tthe rules required disclosing it,\\n\\t\\t\\tand attempted to justify\\n\\t\\t\\tthe free private jet flight\\n\\t\\t\\twith a laughable argument.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito explaining\\n\\t\\t\\tthat on that private jet flight,\\n\\t\\t\\the was in \\\"what would otherwise\\n\\t\\t\\thave been an unoccupied seat\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tCome on!\\n\\t\\t\\tAlito's considered one of the sharpest\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative legal minds,\\n\\t\\t\\tand that's the best he's got?\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you hadn't been in the seat,\\n\\t\\t\\tit would've been empty, Samuel.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat's not so much\\n\\t\\t\\ta defense of your behavior\\n\\t\\t\\tas it is an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\tof how seats work.\\n\\t\\t\\tAlso, it's a private jet.\\n\\t\\t\\tAll the seats are otherwise unoccupied.\\n\\t\\t\\tThey don't overbook them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike it's the 5:05 Spirit Airlines\\n\\t\\t\\tflight from Myrtle Beach to Vegas.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that feels ethically dicey,\\n\\t\\t\\teven before you learn\\n\\t\\t\\tthat one of his hosts on that trip\\n\\t\\t\\twas a hedge fund manager\\n\\t\\t\\twhose companies have since\\n\\t\\t\\thad 10 cases before the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that's not a one-off.\\n\\t\\t\\tFor years, Neil Gorsuch\\n\\t\\t\\thad been trying unsuccessfully\\n\\t\\t\\tto sell a 40-acre piece of property\\n\\t\\t\\tthat he co-owned in Colorado.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut coincidentally, just\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"nine days after he was confirmed\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\the managed to sell it.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while he did disclose\\n\\t\\t\\tthat sale,\\n\\t\\t\\the left the identity of the purchaser\\n\\t\\t\\tblank on the form,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich isn't great,\\n\\t\\t\\t'cause it turned out to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"the chief executive of one\\n\\t\\t\\tof the nation's biggest law firms\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\twhich has since been involved\\n\\t\\t\\tin at least 22 Supreme Court cases.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if you're wondering\\n\\t\\t\\twhat that weird sound is right now,\\n\\t\\t\\tI'm pretty sure\\n\\t\\t\\tit's the ghost of Abe Fortas going:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"Are you kidding me?\\n\\t\\t\\tAre you kidding me?\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the biggest offender on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tis unquestionably Clarence Thomas.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you're unfamiliar with his work,\\n\\t\\t\\tI envy you.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut very

guarantees\\n\\t\\t\\tyou the right to hire a lawyer,\\n\\t\\t\\tnot to have one provided for you.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he once said\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Black civil rights leaders\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"bitch, bitch,

on.\\n\\t\\t\\tProPublica started looking at the shirts\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was wearing in photos,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich helped them\\n\\t\\t\\tuncover some of these trips.\\n\\t\\t\\tJournalism is a

Needed that!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis plus a conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend just now.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tlooks exactly like a person\\n\\t\\t\\twho would try to speak to the\\n\\t\\t\\tmanager about a presidential election.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut, despite that \\\"conversation\\n\\t\\t\\twith my best friend\\\" line,\\n\\t\\t\\tGinni insists she never talked to her\\n\\t\\t\\thusband about the election challenges.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is a bit weird,\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause he says this a lot.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's a particular honor\\n\\t\\t\\tto be here with my wife, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho is totally my best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tin the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love to spend time with my wife,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's my best friend in the world.\\n\\t\\t\\tI love being here\\n\\t\\t\\twith my bride, Virginia,\\n\\t\\t\\twho's a gift from God and\\n\\t\\t\\tmy best friend in the whole world.\\n\\t\\t\\tOkay, first,\\n\\t\\t\\tif Ginni is indeed \\\"a gift from God\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\tI guess it's nice\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Clarence Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tgot at least one gift from someone\\n\\t\\t\\twho is not a billionaire.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut also, it'd seem\\n\\t\\t\\tthat either Ginni Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas keeping her husband up to date\\n\\t\\t\\ton her ongoing coup attempt,\\n\\t\\t\\tor she's Clarence's best friend\\n\\t\\t\\tbut he isn't hers.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that is rough. There's going to be\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of awkward silences\\n\\t\\t\\ton their next motor coach trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut the fact is, a justice's wife\\n\\t\\t\\tinserted herself into efforts\\n\\t\\t\\tto overturn the last election.\\n\\t\\t\\tYet, in multiple cases\\n\\t\\t\\tinvolving January 6th,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas didn't recuse himself,\\n\\t\\t\\teven in one concerning\\n\\t\\t\\twhether White House files,\\n\\t\\t\\twhich could have contained\\n\\t\\t\\tmore of Ginni's texts,\\n\\t\\t\\thad to be handed over\\n\\t\\t\\tto the January 6th committee.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas was the lone dissenter\\n\\t\\t\\tsaying that they should remain secret.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that is not\\n\\t\\t\\ta conflict of interest,\\n\\t\\t\\tI honestly don't know\\n\\t\\t\\twhat one is.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe fundamental corruption here\\n\\t\\t\\tmight be bigger than anything\\n\\t\\t\\tone recusal could cover.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause I'm not saying that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tis only voting the way he is\\n\\t\\t\\tbecause of the trips and the gifts.\\n\\t\\t\\tHis opinions were horrible\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore he ever set foot on a yacht.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat doesn't mean those billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thaven't had a real impact on him.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, for years,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas repeatedly talked about money.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn the 1980s, he told a reporter\\n\\t\\t\\the planned to be rich,\\n\\t\\t\\tand said that means\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"more than just a few\\n\\t\\t\\thundred thousand dollars a year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tBut unfortunately for him,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat's exactly what being\\n\\t\\t\\ta Supreme Court justice pays,\\n\\t\\t\\tjust under $300,000.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's been pretty vocal\\n\\t\\t\\tabout his dissatisfaction with that,\\n\\t\\t\\tsometimes even publicly.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe job is not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor what they pay.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the grief,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it is worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the principle.\\n\\t\\t\\tYou sure about that?\\n\\t\\t\\t'Cause your job is writing opinions\\n\\t\\t\\tin a bathrobe and it pays six figures.\\n\\t\\t\\tMost bloggers do that for free,\\n\\t\\t\\tand they don't get to enjoy\\n\\t\\t\\tseeing their worst takes\\n\\t\\t\\tbecoming everyone else's law.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt was right around that time,\\n\\t\\t\\tin the early aughts,\\n\\t\\t\\tthat Thomas reportedly said to\\n\\t\\t\\ta Republican member of Congress\\n\\t\\t\\tthat, unless it gave Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices a pay raise, quote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"One or more will leave soon.\\n\\t\\t\\tMaybe in the next year\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tThat set off alarm bells\\n\\t\\t\\tin conservative quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\tAs that lawmaker Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tspoke to recalls it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"His importance as a conservative\\n\\t\\t\\twas paramount.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe wanted to make sure\\n\\t\\t\\the felt comfortable in his job\\n\\t\\t\\tand he was being paid properly.\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, for Thomas,\\n\\t\\t\\tjustices' salaries haven't been raised\\n\\t\\t\\tbeyond inflation since then.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut it may not be a coincidence\\n\\t\\t\\tthat a handful of billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave suddenly stepped in\\n\\t\\t\\tto make sure that Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\twas never anything less\\n\\t\\t\\tthan extremely comfortable.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd in recent years, he's seemed\\n\\t\\t\\tmuch less worried about his paycheck.\\n\\t\\t\\tRight now, what is the compensation\\n\\t\\t\\tof a justice of the Supreme Court?\\n\\t\\t\\tGoodness, I think it's plenty.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's not quite where you are,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut it's\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tI have no\\u2026\\n\\t\\t\\tMy wife and I are doing fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't live extravagantly,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut we are fine.\\n\\t\\t\\tHere's a fun fact for you:\\n\\t\\t\\tthat was in early June of 2019.\\n\\t\\t\\tGuess where he was\\n\\t\\t\\tat the end of that month?\\n\\t\\t\\tOn Harlan Crow's\\n\\t\\t\\tIndonesian yacht trip.\\n\\t\\t\\tThat is the comfortable laugh of a man\\n\\t\\t\\tlooking forward to a free trip\\n\\t\\t\\tand, fingers crossed,\\n\\t\\t\\ta free shirt to go with it.\\n\\t\\t\\tBasically, what I'm suggesting is,\\n\\t\\t\\tit's not that these billionaires have\\n\\t\\t\\tpaid Thomas to change his views.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's that they like his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tso they're paying for him not to leave.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhich is different, but not better.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd if that was their plan,\\n\\t\\t\\tit has worked.\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas is at the heart of the new\\n\\t\\t\\tconservative supermajority on the court\\n\\t\\t\\tand has plans to go further.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn his concurrence in the Dobbs case,\\n\\t\\t\\the said the court should reconsider\\n\\t\\t\\tprevious erroneous rulings on sodomy,\\n\\t\\t\\tbirth control, and gay marriage.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd despite being known\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the consistency of his views,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere is one key issue\\n\\t\\t\\ton which he's evolved.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause remember that Chevron\\n\\t\\t\\tdeference that I mentioned earlier?\\n\\t\\t\\t20 years ago,\\n\\t\\t\\tThomas wrote a majority opinion\\n\\t\\t\\tthat expanded\\n\\t\\t\\tChevron's protections.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut since then,\\n\\t\\t\\tthere's been a massive conservative\\n\\t\\t\\tpush to get rid of Chevron,\\n\\t\\t\\tled by the Koch Organization,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know, Clarence's vacation friends.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd a few years ago, Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\trenounced his earlier decision,\\n\\t\\t\\twriting that he'd determined that the\\n\\t\\t\\tdoctrine is unconstitutional after all.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat caused that change of heart?\\n\\t\\t\\tI don't know.\\n\\t\\t\\tWas it 15 years of marinating\\n\\t\\t\\tin right-wing money, and vacationing\\n\\t\\t\\twith businessmen who could massively\\n\\t\\t\\tprofit from it being overturned?\\n\\t\\t\\tWe can't say for sure. But we can\\n\\t\\t\\tall think it together, can't we?\\n\\t\\t\\tReady? Let's do that. One, two, three,\\n\\t\\t\\tyes, it's because of the money.\\n\\t\\t\\tShit, sorry, I thought it so hard\\n\\t\\t\\tit came out of my mouth.\\n\\t\\t\\tI know we focused a lot\\n\\t\\t\\ton Clarence Thomas tonight,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut this story\\n\\t\\t\\tisn't just about his integrity.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt's about the court's.\\n\\t\\t\\tFrom the beginning, America,\\n\\t\\t\\tlike most countries,\\n\\t\\t\\twas built on polite fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\tby men who could somehow\\n\\t\\t\\thold in their heads\\n\\t\\t\\tthe idea that all men\\n\\t\\t\\twere created equal,\\n\\t\\t\\tat the same time that they were drawing\\n\\t\\t\\tup the Three-Fifths Compromise.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd while we've shed\\n\\t\\t\\ta lot of those fictions,\\n\\t\\t\\twe still cling to the idea\\n\\t\\t\\tof the Supreme Court\\n\\t\\t\\tas a body separate\\n\\t\\t\\tand apart from politics.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt retains a certain amount\\n\\t\\t\\tof mystique and ceremony.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe put the justices on a pedestal,\\n\\t\\t\\tand let them wear robes like wizards.\\n\\t\\t\\tIn their confirmation hearings,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey pretend to have no idea\\n\\t\\t\\thow they'll rule on hot-button issues,\\n\\t\\t\\tand we all have to pretend\\n\\t\\t\\tto believe them\\n\\t\\t\\tbefore we appoint them to a job\\n\\t\\t\\tthat they can hold until they die.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe don't treat them\\n\\t\\t\\tlike what they are, which is people,\\n\\t\\t\\twho can be motivated by ideology\\n\\t\\t\\tand greed, like anybody else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut polite fictions can only be bent\\n\\t\\t\\tso far before they break.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd right now, it feels like the\\n\\t\\t\\tSupreme Court is at a breaking point.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd there are small ways to fix that,\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom a real, enforceable ethics code,\\n\\t\\t\\tto term limits, to even potentially\\n\\t\\t\\texpanding the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd honestly, if it were up to me,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey'd also be dressed not in robes,\\n\\t\\t\\tbut as Walmart greeters,\\n\\t\\t\\tto emphasize they're not magic,\\n\\t\\t\\tthey're humans, like everyone else.\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if we're not going to do\\n\\t\\t\\tany of that,\\n\\t\\t\\tif we're going to keep\\n\\t\\t\\tthe bar of accountability this low,\\n\\t\\t\\tperhaps it's time\\n\\t\\t\\tto exploit that low bar\\n\\t\\t\\tthe same way billionaires\\n\\t\\t\\thave successfully done for decades.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd that finally brings us\\n\\t\\t\\tto the solution that I mentioned\\n\\t\\t\\tat the start of this piece.\\n\\t\\t\\tClarence Thomas is arguably the most\\n\\t\\t\\tconsequential justice on the court.\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd he's never really\\n\\t\\t\\tseemed to like the job.\\n\\t\\t\\tHe's said it's not worth doing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the grief\\\".\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, what if he could keep the luxury\\n\\t\\t\\tperks that he clearly enjoys,\\n\\t\\t\\twithout having to endure\\n\\t\\t\\tall of that grief?\\n\\t\\t\\tI think there might actually\\n\\t\\t\\tbe a way to do that.\\n\\t\\t\\tBecause, Justice Thomas, we have\\n\\t\\t\\ta special offer for you tonight.\\n\\t\\t\\tWe are prepared to offer you\\n\\t\\t\\t$1 million a year,\\n\\t\\t\\tfor the rest of your life,\\n\\t\\t\\tif you simply agree\\n\\t\\t\\tto leave the Supreme Court immediately\\n\\t\\t\\tand never come back.\\n\\t\\t\\tIt is that simple.\\n\\t\\t\\tJust sign this contract, resign,\\n\\t\\t\\tand the money is all yours!\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is not a joke.\\n\\t\\t\\tIf you watch our show,\\n\\t\\t\\tyou know jokes aren't really our thing.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis is real.
