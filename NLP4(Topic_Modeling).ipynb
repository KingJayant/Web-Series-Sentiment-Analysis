compliment okay anyway very sorry to hear about your father thank you well fatherinlaw but thank you really i thought it was your father no its lorraines fatherinlaw yeah thats a little better well its my fatherinlaw lts a loss duane of course its a loss but you know its not your dad larry its a human being yeah of course i know that im just trying to delineate the differences between a father and a fatherinlaw its a very sad thing your dads still alive yeah there you go yeah thats a gift and you know its like if you have im sorry did you say a dog yeah a dog say your dog dies thats one thing thats terrible but if your friends dog dies its not quite the same but anyway is your wife around lorraine is she here can i talk to her maybe we just let her rest will you tell her how sorry i am about her dad are you because it doesnt really sound like it between you and me my condolences arent quite as deep as the average persons im picking that up its like people telling each other they

that hangs over my yard the roots theyre damaging my pipes so we got to do something about this tree dont worry about the research ill look into it ill get an estimate well sit down and well split the cost of the tree maintenance and we can keep enjoying these lemons split the cost of the tree duane i mean you know come on its your tree its on your side its our tree its not our tree let me get this right so its our tree when you want lemons and its my tree when we have to take care of it and maintain it i want some lemons i dont want lemons you think i need lemons in my life i can go the rest of my life without touching a lemon no lemons for life i put it on a piece of fish whatre you gonna substitute for lemons a grapefruit youre gonna put grapefruit on fish i put grapefruits on fish when i havent actually put it on but ive thought about it really yeah my point is lemons are a fungible citrus just look around the room weve suffered a loss you lost your fatherinlaw id appreciate you stepping up and being a neighbor and paying for half of this tree maintenance thank you for coming out had i known that it was his fatherinlaw i never wouldve gone to the house in the first place and this lemon thing by the way you know hes a descendant of harriet tubman well youd think his ancestors would be ashamed of him no the lemons drop what am i supposed to do throw em back over the fence

very painful time got it okay just curious so the invoice i got the invoice from the tree service they had to remove the stump too if we could just split that down the middle okay come on duane they had to remove the stump for eating a couple of lemons a month and thats how much it costs to get rid of a tree duane i got to tell you something okay this is very untubmanlike behavior thats the second time with tubmans i dont know what you mean l dont think that your great aunt harriet would condone this so what kind of person was she larry well she was the kind of person who smuggled slaves

in the last two months from ron desantis ending his campaign to nikki haley losing the nevada primary to none of these candidates but the story im most sad to have missed concerned the sudden mania around a hole shaped like a rat on a chicago street or rat hole as it became known which probably peaked with this you knew it was inevitable a chicago rat hole wedding wedding bells on saturday at whats become chicagos hottest tourist attraction the chicago rat hole raj and his partner looked at a lot of chicago landmarks for their wedding until nine days ago when he saw the story of the chicago rat hole we were viewing a lot of different venues a lot of different big monuments in chicago and finally we looked at each other and we were like lets get married at the rat hole yes say what you will that marriage is gonna last forever nothing says a relationship is solid like waiting until nine fucking days before your wedding to pick a venue then looking into each others eyes and both saying lets get married at the rat hole that is true love right there the holes emergence as a tourist attraction became a bit of a nuisance for neighbors though which may explain why shortly before that wedding this happened at some point today or yesterday someone filled in chicagos most famous concrete attraction what were your feelings when you came to the rat hole and you saw it was filled in with concrete i dont understand why everyones trying to block our good time exactly shes right let us enjoy one thing just one thing filling in the rat hole is a grave injustice both figuratively and literally id love to spend this entire episode talking about rat holes god knows ive done it before but theres more to catch up on in russia putin has been busy one of his most prominent critics alexei navalny died in a siberian prison this week for reasons any idiot can figure out making it a bit awkward that last week noted idiot tucker carlson sat down with putin for a fawning interview in which he failed to meaningfully challenge him tucker was so docile even putin later made fun of him i thought hed be aggressive asking these socalled sharp questions i wasnt simply ready for it i wanted it because it would give me a chance to respond equally sharply which in my view would give specificity to our entire conversation but he chose a different tactic frankly speaking i didnt get complete pleasure from this interview theres embarrassing and theres getting roasted by putin for being a lap dog embarrassing also why on earth did he think thered be sharp questions if whoever prepped putin for that interview said anything other than youre about to talk to the dumbest brooks brother so feel free to take a nap they should be fired meanwhile in the middle east israel continued its assault on gaza with over palestinians now dead most of them women and children this week saw attacks in rafah the city that stands as the last refuge for gazan civilians and yet the us refuses to curtail military aid to israel instead offering tepid rebukes like biden saying israels actions are over the top while the white house leaks that privately the presidents very upset part of what the president is saying according to people whove heard him make these comments is that netanyahu is quote giving him hell that hes impossible to deal with were also told on three at least three instances the president referred to netanyahu as an ahole careful there joe what if bibi hears you nothing shames the guy comfortable with bombing hospitals and refugee camps like knowing that miles away an is muttering words under his breath next biden is going to whisper what a dick into a seashell and toss it into the ocean biden has reportedly said much worse which american tv danced around but arabiclanguage al jazeera delivered the quote in full and were not going to translate this for you but youll know the phrase when you hear it bad fucking guy yeah biden apparently called netanyahu a bad fucking guy you should be allowed to say that about netanyahu uncensored on american tv because i guarantee its coming out the mouths of gazans and the families of the hostages nonstop right now the presidents likely opponent in november has been taking a break between court dates and accumulating massive financial penalties to offer his own plans for international relations first saying that if nato members dont pay their bills which isnt a thing hed encourage russia to do whatever the hell they want then he suggested aid to ukraine should actually be a loan then got distracted then distracted again from his original distraction why should you just hand it over to em do it as a form of a loan i do that with athletes like a professional golfer who i think is very good they dont have any money but they have a lot of talent ill say heres the deal i did it with a number of people heres the deal what i wanna do professional golfer play golf i play very nice did you see the picture of me with the stomach out to here so what i do is im putting up today a picture of me actually what i actually look like hitting a ball smashing the fricking ball and youll see quite i wouldnt say slim i wouldnt say slim but not bad but the ball does go far i would say it goes about nine times further than biden can hit it what i havent watched trump speak in so long i forgot how jampacked with nonsense every sentence is its the little details like the way he suddenly yelled hand it over to them as if a ghost jabbed him in the ribs midsentence i dont want to be overdramatic but the idea of watching clips of him talking every week for the next year makes me want to book a trip on the next titan submersible and i know no one watching this needs a reminder that we have a long grim election year ahead of us but keep in mind its only february we need to pace ourselves or were going to get burned out and want to crawl into a small hole and wait for it to be over though i will say if that does happen i know a pretty good hole in chicago thats apparently available and now this and now chuck grassley celebrates his favorite holiday unfortunately this is a little bit like the movie groundhogs day some days constituent correspondence may seem like the movie groundhog day immigration is becoming the groundhog day of the united states senate so its kind of groundhog day once again yesterday we also had groundhogs day my first chart is a depiction of punxsutawney phil in the past i have compared this constant repetition to a film called groundhog day starring bill murray where bill murrays character relives the same day over and over again next to me is this chart from the movie groundhog day groundhog day is also the title of a famous film starring bill murray so i have another picture for you of phil and bill driving along moving on our main story tonight concerns the courts the dignified palaces of justice which during covid brought us spectacular moments like this mr ponton i believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings it is and i dont know how to remove it ive got my assistant here shes trying to but im prepared to go forward with it im here live im not a cat perfect you know a hearings off to a shaky start when a lawyer has to clarify that he is not a cat and i did not want him to uncat himself there i wanted that man to spend the rest of the hearing as a photorealistic kitten looking like he witnessed a double homicide were going to talk about the supreme court which is set to have a monumental year not only will it take on cases concerning the availability of mifepristone and whether trumps immune from prosecution for his role in january its also considering one case centering on something called chevron deference it sounds like the title of a spy novel that youd burn through at an airport but its a vitally important legal precedent that says that when there is ambiguity in the letter of a law courts should defer to regulatory agencies expertise do you like it when the epa regulates pollution or the fda regulates drugs much of their ability to do that comes from chevron deference and if the court guts it itll be much easier for private industries to block government regulation so this is gonna be a huge year for a court that has seldom been more powerful and yet respect for it has seldom been lower the courts public approval rating has dropped to a low with just expressing great confidence its true and its hard to think of anything people have less confidence in right now aside from maybe the window seats in boeing planes and there are understandable reasons for that from the unpopular decision overturning roe v wade to the fact that onethird of the court was appointed sometimes under dubious circumstances by a man who never won the popular vote but the past year has also introduced us to a whole new reason to question the courts integrity thanks to a steady drumbeat of stories like these supreme court justice clarence thomas is facing new allegations he accepted luxurious vacations and gifts from wealthy individuals and didnt properly disclose them politico reported justice neil gorsuch sold property he owned to the head of a major law firm justice samuel alito defended himself after he didnt report a luxury trip to alaska and a private jet flight the report details that in july of that year they stayed at the king salmon lodge and were served multicourse meals of alaskan king crab legs or kobe filet they also enjoyed wine that cost a bottle alito denies he did anything wrong and specifically said if there was wine it was certainly not wine that costs which i hope is true for multiple reasons namely that wine should never cost because wine is not that good a drink think about the words people use to describe good wine complex thats just a fancy word for confusing earthy thats literally dirt flavor and smooth your best compliment is that it didnt fight you on the way down its a bad drink but the cost of the wine which again should be zero isnt the point here stories like those have further undermined public trust in the court which is a big problem because its an institution that relies on respect it cant enforce its own rulings and without public buyin it could theoretically be ignored chief justice roberts himself recently wrote public trust is essential not incidental to our function these scandals are a huge issue for it given that wed thought wed look at how deep this courts problems go and a possible solution that might go oneninth of the way towards helping things get better and lets start with a striking fact when it comes to what ethical rules the court is required to follow there basically arent any congress can impeach a justice in extreme scenarios but short of that the court essentially regulates itself and that has happened in the past in the justice abe fortas was involved in a number of scandals including taking money to advise a businessman who wound up having a case before the court but despite the fact that getting paid for outside work was legal and that fortas both returned the money and recused himself from the case the mere appearance of impropriety caused lawmakers of both parties to call for his resignation he stepped down saying that he was doing so for the good of the court and just a few weeks later the us judicial conference unveiled a new ethics policy for federal judges with one tiny exception see if you can spot it the united states judicial judicial conference today issued a code of ethics which forbids all federal judges except supreme court justices from accepting fees gifts or compensation of any kind for offbench activities the supreme court justices were exempt that new rule solved every problem except for the one they just had and thereve been multiple tweaks to the code of ethics over the years with the one constant being that the supreme court justices are not covered by it and even laws that apply to them are basically unenforceable the argument is that because they are the highest court in the land theres no one they can answer to over the years the justices have noted that they voluntarily follow certain rules theyre required to report any gifts worth more than that is how we learned about ruth bader ginsburg receiving a opera costume ketanji brown jackson receiving a floral arrangement from oprah worth and antonin scalia receiving two firearms and worth of dictionaries which is slightly weirdly phrased because worth of dictionaries could either mean one very luxurious dictionary or regular ones but while those gifts were disclosed others havent been scalia had a habit of not disclosing trips that other people paid for and died while staying for free at the hunting lodge of a business executive whose company had recently had a case before the court and i bet that executive was very glad he got the ruling before that funsounding visit and as youve already seen some justices have run with that precedent remember alitos fishing trip when it came to light he said that he didnt think the rules required disclosing it and attempted to justify the free private jet flight with a laughable argument alito explaining that on that private jet flight he was in what would otherwise have been an unoccupied seat come on alitos considered one of the sharpest conservative legal minds and thats the best hes got if you hadnt been in the seat it wouldve been empty samuel thats not so much a defense of your behavior as it is an explanation of how seats work also its a private jet all the seats are otherwise unoccupied they dont overbook them like its the spirit airlines flight from myrtle beach to vegas and that feels ethically dicey even before you learn that one of his hosts on that trip was a hedge fund manager whose companies have since had cases before the court and thats not a oneoff for years neil gorsuch had been trying unsuccessfully to sell a piece of property that he coowned in colorado but coincidentally just nine days after he was confirmed he managed to sell it and while he did disclose that sale he left the identity of the purchaser blank on the form which isnt great cause it turned out to be the chief executive of one of the nations biggest law firms which has since been involved in at least supreme court cases and if youre wondering what that weird sound is right now im pretty sure its the ghost of abe fortas going are you kidding me are you kidding me but the biggest offender on the court is unquestionably clarence thomas if youre unfamiliar with his work i envy you but very quickly hes an extreme originalist known for adopting hardright positions years before other justices come around to them from overturning gun laws to undermining the voting rights act hes also questioned whether poor people have a right to a lawyer saying the constitution only guarantees you the right to hire a lawyer not to have one provided for you and he once said that black civil rights leaders bitch bitch bitch moan and moan whine and whine and sure why cant the people fighting for basic equality just have the chill goodtime vibes that we all associate with clarence fucking thomas hes so fun to be around ask almost any woman whos ever worked for him for years there have been stories about thomas accepting lavish gifts but things escalated recently with a series of propublica investigations revealing thomas relationship with these four conservative billionaires the report says the four moguls collectively treated thomas to destination vacations private jet flights plus an additional eight by helicopter a dozen vip passes to professional and college sporting events two stays at luxury resorts in florida and jamaica and one standing invitation to an uberexclusive golf club the dollar value likely in the millions just one of those vacations was a nineday indonesian superyacht voyage that if hed paid for it himself could have exceeded over half a million dollars and the way propublica tracked down some of those trips is pretty great the host of that indonesian vacation and multiple others was harlan crow a billionaire who has given millions to efforts to move the law and the judiciary to the right crow liked to give out commemorative polo shirts for the trips that he took people on propublica started looking at the shirts thomas was wearing in photos which helped them uncover some of these trips journalism is a crapshoot sometimes you spend weeks hunting down leads painstakingly building a timeline other times your target just posts a photo of himself on facebook wearing a tshirt that says secret undeclared yacht vacation and gives the whole game away those reporters also tracked down photos and cards that thomas wife ginni sent to friends to commemorate their trips with fun captions like five couples ready for river rafting the sokols took four lucky couples to the first nebraska footbal misspelled game of the season and this photo of a trump administration attorney and his wife captioned mark and tricia paoletta sang a special tribute to clarence they created and every single one of those photos looks like it was on the mood board for get out but wait cause im still not done they also found this photorealistic painting that harlan crow commissioned of one of those vacations featuring him thomas leonard leo of the conservative federalist society and a statue of a native american man seemingly praying for lightning to strike this exact spot but if youre thinking that that is the worst piece of art harlan crow owns you are mistaken published reports say dallas tycoon harlan crows controversial collection includes hitlers notorious autobiography mein kampf signed by hitler oil paintings by hitler and linen napkins embroidered with the nazi swastika the collection is housed at crows mansion in dallas i cant get over the collection of nazi memorabilia said one guest who saw the nazi treasure trove you sort of just gasp when you walk into the room yeah i bet you do because that is a bit of a red flag specifically this red flag crow says his controversial artifacts are part of a collection meant to preserve a part of our history and to understand how we all got here and im guessing his guests ask that exact question when they see his signed copy of mein kampf for the first time how the fuck did i get here though bad news for harlan about at least one of his hitler paintings an expert has since deemed it definitely not authentic which i guess he probably shouldve seen coming as it was signed a hitler and not the hitler crows also repeatedly flown thomas out on his jet for trips to the bohemian grove the california retreat for the rich and powerful where he and the koch brothers apparently developed a bond here is thomas with one of them and ken burns for some fucking reason thomas has also incidentally attended koch donor events at least twice serving as a fundraising draw for an organization that regularly brings cases before the court his excuse for not reporting any of this was that he sought guidance from my colleagues and others and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends was not reportable and while it is true the judicial guidelines have an exception for personal hospitality experts will point out that means dinner at someones house not a ninedayall expensespaid yacht trip a pretty good rule of thumb is if it could be a prize on the price is right its not personal hospitality and thomas has received more than just hospitality anyway in one of harlan crows companies bought a string of properties in savannah including thomas childhood home where his mother still lives crow also reportedly paid for two years of private school for thomas grandnephew who apparently thomas has raised as a son and which based on the tuition rates at the time amounted to roughly neither of those were disclosed at the time either and it gets pretty hard to square the lavish vacations the real estate the tuition with thomas insistence that hes an iconoclastic voice for the little guy in appearances like this one from two years ago where he thanked the people whod shown up to support him during his confirmation hearing the regular people showed up and it was always us against the elites and thats the way it has been for the last years ive been in public life us against the elites i get it so the destination vacations were just part of your us versus the elites plot right lull them into a false sense of security then presumably on the vacation vive la rvolution i love it what a plan but that sounds like horseshit even before you see that this is how that talk started im sure you and all of us want to join harlan thank harlan crow and his family for making this wonderful facility available to us i know harlan hates that i knew we had to thats why i wouldnt say it id like to keep that friendship i bet you would im sure friendship is the thing that you like the most about knowing harlan crow not the lavish yacht trips or the private jet flights the simple human companionship of an aging nazi napkin collector but perhaps the item that perfectly sums up the distance between thomas regularguy persona and his highend tastes is his motor home it is his prize possession he even showed it off during his minutes interview one of his passions is this motor home that he and his wife use to explore the united states in their downtime do you find this relaxing yeah its away from the meanness that you see in washington and you get here with just the regular folks and its so pleasant i can see that people in washington can be so mean cant they ive heard some even make decisions in landmark court cases that loosen gun regulations limit affirmative action and strip women of their constitutional right to an abortion so i get the impulse to want to get outta town to avoid those fucking sociopaths thomas loves his motor home so much he can be a bit of a snob if asked inaccurately about it one of you enjoys traveling crosscountry with your spouse in a rv whos that thats technically incorrect is it not an rv it is a motor coach is that bigger than an rv it could be but it is a better vehicle than an rv an rv is normally built on a light truck chassis a motor coach is a tour bus i mean its old but its really nice honestly if thomas hadnt caused so much human misery him liking big comfy trucks that go vroomvroom would be genuinely charming every man in his has picked a vehicle that occupies way too much space in his brain and heart some like trains that go choochoo some like boats that go glubglub and others love motor coaches based on a nonlighttruck chassis im not saying these men love their vehicles more than their families its just its easier for them to say i prefer o scale trains because historically thats what this countrys finest model trains have been since the than im proud of you son but about that bus it is apparently the rollsroyce of motor coaches a custom prevost marathon or as thomas himself once put it a condo on wheels and if youre thinking thats a pretty big purchase for a supreme court justice to be able to afford about that supreme court justice clarence thomas has been an rv evangelist for decades traveling the country in a luxury motor coach that he purchased in after borrowing more than a quarter of a million dollars from a wealthy friend but a new report from democrats on the senate finance committee alleges thomas friend forgave a substantial amount of that massive loan and nine years later his friend forgave all the debt that sounds like a sweet deal its starting to feel like thomas doesnt so much have friends as a collection of human atms and his wealthy friends will say there is nothing to see here theyre just doing for clarence what they would do for anyone else harlan crow pulled that exact move in a statement harlan crow the dallas real estate billionaire who picks up the tabs for the trips says he and thomas have been friends since the hospitality we have extended to the thomases over the years is no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends okay but it is different though while you may have been friends with clarence thomas for a long time you didnt start being friends with him until five years after he was made a supreme court justice each of his four major benefactors appears to have first met thomas after he ascended to the supreme court which is inherently telling even socially inept high schoolers can figure that out if brenna jackson and ashton only start hanging out with you after you get a job at coldstone its not about you its about the free fucking scoops and thankfully there is a way for a justice to avoid the appearance of impropriety and that is recusal any justice is required to disqualify themselves in any proceeding where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned but as with everything else youve seen tonight for the supreme court its essentially just a suggestion the justices themselves decide if they are able to be impartial and those decisions cannot then be appealed even when it comes to recusals thomas is an outlier he almost never recuses even when he clearly should take one recent case where he had a flagrant conflict of interest albeit not a financial one because the court recently took up a number of appeals involving cases surrounding january and as it happens a major cheerleader to overturn bidens win was thomas own wife ginni as her texts to thenwhite house chief of staff mark meadows show in one thomas writing quote help this great president stand firm mark biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history and in another just days the election thomas writing do not concede on november meadows wrote thomas this is a fight of good versus evil thomas replied thank you needed that this plus a conversation with my best friend just now ginni thomas looks exactly like a person who would try to speak to the manager about a presidential election but despite that conversation with my best friend line ginni insists she never talked to her husband about the election challenges which is a bit weird because he says this a lot its a particular honor to be here with my wife virginia who is totally my best friend in the world i love to spend time with my wife whos my best friend in the world i love being here with my bride virginia whos a gift from god and my best friend in the whole world okay first if ginni is indeed a gift from god i guess its nice that clarence thomas got at least one gift from someone who is not a billionaire but also itd seem that either ginni thomas was keeping her husband up to date on her ongoing coup attempt or shes clarences best friend but he isnt hers and that is rough theres going to be a lot of awkward silences on their next motor coach trip but the fact is a justices wife inserted herself into efforts to overturn the last election yet in multiple cases involving january thomas didnt recuse himself even in one concerning whether white house files which could have contained more of ginnis texts had to be handed over to the january committee thomas was the lone dissenter saying that they should remain secret and if that is not a conflict of interest i honestly dont know what one is the fundamental corruption here might be bigger than anything one recusal could cover because im not saying that thomas is only voting the way he is because of the trips and the gifts his opinions were horrible before he ever set foot on a yacht that doesnt mean those billionaires havent had a real impact on him because for years thomas repeatedly talked about money in the he told a reporter he planned to be rich and said that means more than just a few hundred thousand dollars a year but unfortunately for him thats exactly what being a supreme court justice pays just under and hes been pretty vocal about his dissatisfaction with that sometimes even publicly the job is not worth doing for what they pay its not worth doing for the grief but it is worth doing for the principle you sure about that cause your job is writing opinions in a bathrobe and it pays six figures most bloggers do that for free and they dont get to enjoy seeing their worst takes becoming everyone elses law it was right around that time in the early aughts that thomas reportedly said to a republican member of congress that unless it gave supreme court justices a pay raise quote one or more will leave soon maybe in the next year that set off alarm bells in conservative quarters as that lawmaker thomas spoke to recalls it his importance as a conservative was paramount we wanted to make sure he felt comfortable in his job and he was being paid properly unfortunately for thomas justices salaries havent been raised beyond inflation since then but it may not be a coincidence that a handful of billionaires have suddenly stepped in to make sure that thomas was never anything less than extremely comfortable and in recent years hes seemed much less worried about his paycheck right now what is the compensation of a justice of the supreme court goodness i think its plenty its not quite where you are but its i have no my wife and i are doing fine we dont live extravagantly but we are fine heres a fun fact for you that was in early june of guess where he was at the end of that month on harlan crows indonesian yacht trip that is the comfortable laugh of a man looking forward to a free trip and fingers crossed a free shirt to go with it basically what im suggesting is its not that these billionaires have paid thomas to change his views its that they like his views so theyre paying for him not to leave which is different but not better and if that was their plan it has worked thomas is at the heart of the new conservative supermajority on the court and has plans to go further in his concurrence in the dobbs case he said the court should reconsider previous erroneous rulings on sodomy birth control and gay marriage and despite being known for the consistency of his views there is one key issue on which hes evolved because remember that chevron deference that i mentioned earlier years ago thomas wrote a majority opinion that expanded chevrons protections but since then theres been a massive conservative push to get rid of chevron led by the koch organization you know clarences vacation friends and a few years ago thomas renounced his earlier decision writing that hed determined that the doctrine is unconstitutional after all what caused that change of heart i dont know was it years of marinating in rightwing money and vacationing with businessmen who could massively profit from it being overturned we cant say for sure but we can all think it together cant we ready lets do that one two three yes its because of the money shit sorry i thought it so hard it came out of my mouth i know we focused a lot on clarence thomas tonight but this story isnt just about his integrity its about the courts from the beginning america like most countries was built on polite fictions by men who could somehow hold in their heads the idea that all men were created equal at the same time that they were drawing up the threefifths compromise and while weve shed a lot of those fictions we still cling to the idea of the supreme court as a body separate and apart from politics it retains a certain amount of mystique and ceremony we put the justices on a pedestal and let them wear robes like wizards in their confirmation hearings they pretend to have no idea how theyll rule on hotbutton issues and we all have to pretend to believe them before we appoint them to a job that they can hold until they die we dont treat them like what they are which is people who can be motivated by ideology and greed like anybody else but polite fictions can only be bent so far before they break and right now it feels like the supreme court is at a breaking point and there are small ways to fix that from a real enforceable ethics code to term limits to even potentially expanding the court and honestly if it were up to me theyd also be dressed not in robes but as walmart greeters to emphasize theyre not magic theyre humans like everyone else but if were not going to do any of that if were going to keep the bar of accountability this low perhaps its time to exploit that low bar the same way billionaires have successfully done for decades and that finally brings us to the solution that i mentioned at the start of this piece clarence thomas is arguably the most consequential justice on the court and hes never really seemed to like the job hes said its not worth doing for the grief so what if he could keep the luxury perks that he clearly enjoys without having to endure all of that grief i think there might actually be a way to do that because justice thomas we have a special offer for you tonight we are prepared to offer you million a year for the rest of your life if you simply agree to leave the supreme court immediately and never come back it is that simple just sign this contract resign and the money is all yours this is not a joke if you watch our show you know jokes arent really our thing this is real a million dollars a year until you or i die we have spoken to experts whove all told us that best they can tell this is somehow legal which seems crazy to me cause it really feels like it shouldnt be but as they keep pointing out there are no rules in place to stop me from doing this and let me be clear hbo is not putting up the money for this i am personally on the hook you could make me really regret this i could be doing standup tours to pay for your retirement for years but this offer is not forever you have days from midnight tonight to make your resignation effective and if you are still on the fence i have a little deal sweetener that im excited to show you so please come with me come this way we know youve got a lot on your plate right now from stripping away womens rights to hearing january cases you definitely shouldnt be hearing to potentially helping roll back decades of federal regulations and you deserve a break away from the meanness of washington so you can be surrounded by the regular folks whose lives youve made demonstrably worse for decades now and the good news is i think we can help you there since your favorite mode of travel might be in need of an upgrade we are excited to offer you this brand new topoftheline prevost marathon motor coach look at this beauty clarence its worth million and its got a full bedroom yes that is a king bed one and a half baths a fucking fireplace four tvs a washerdryer and i quote a residentialsized fridge and if youre thinking what will my friends say if i take this offer will they judge me as they sit in their boardrooms and mega yachts and hitler shrines will they still treat me to luxury vacations and sing songs about me off their phones thats the beauty of friendship clarence if theyre friends theyll love you no matter what your job is so i guess this might be the perfect way to find out who your real friends actually are so thats the offer a million dollars a year clarence and a brandnew condo on wheels all you have to do in
